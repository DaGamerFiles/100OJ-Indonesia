<0000> After a group of giants popped out of nowhere, QP, Suguri, Marc, and Natsumi worked together and drove them away. But it isn't over yet...
<0001> Guys! Tomomo's this way!\nI can smell her! Because I'm a Pomeranian!
<0002> I'm proud of you, Q!
<0003> She's very close... I can tell we'll reach her soon!
<0004> L-look... What is that?
<0005> Looks like... black fog?\nThere's someone lying down in front of it. Isn't that...
<0006> Tomomo!?
<0007> Uuu...
<0008> What happened?
<0009> G-guys, you've all got to be careful...
<0010> Fufufu, I welcome you all.
<0011> W-who are you!?
<0012> Since you girls take such good care of Tomomo, I thought I should come out... and say hi.
<0013> I'm Tomomo's mama, Mioâ™¥
<0014> Whaaaat!?
<0015> She's Tomomo's...
<0016> Mama...?
<0017> No, she's not!
<0018> She's not?
<0019> Very obviously not! I'll tell you who she truly is...
<0020> She's the devil... who set me up to become a magical girl!
<0021> Oh dear, how could you say something like that to the one who granted you such wonderful powers?
<0022> Shut it! Turning a woman in her mid-20s into a magical girl!? What kind of joke is that!?
<0023> A funny one. But you look just fantastic that way.
<0024> You son of a...!
<0025> But you're aware the powers I gave you are all genuine, aren't you?\nYou even used them to create this board gaming world.
<0026> Though I am a little disappointed in you. If you wanted, you could've created games far more intense than this one.
<0027> Rolling dice and gathering stars? How lame and boring...
<0028> None of your business! I like games where people can laugh and have fun together!
<0029> Oh, no. Mama didn't raise you to be someone like that.
<0030> You never raised me! And stop calling yourself "Mama".
<0031> What will I do with such a rebellious child... But don't worry, Tomomo.\nNow that I'm here, I'll help you make this world a much better place.
<0032> What are you going to do...!
<0033> What's with these tremors...?
<0034> GUPPIPOO!
<0035> Oh my god! That's one huge mix-up!
<0036> The giants we beat earlier... Did they combine into one?
<0037> Stop messing up my world as you please...!
<0038> Fufufu, it's more exciting like this, isn't it?
<0039> We thought Tomomo created those giants, but...
<0040> It looks like we were mistaken.
<0041> Ahaha! I told you - I came here to say hi!
<0042> And now...
<0043> You're all going to play a game with me, Mio the Magical Devil!
<0044> N-no...
<0045> I name this... the "100% Blood Orange Juice"!
<0046> Ahaha! What a waste of effort.\nYou'll never beat me with those pitiful dice rolls.
<0047> Damn it... She's got to be cheating.
<0048> Fufu, I'll tell you my secret!
<0049> My HP is 9999! It's a whole 9999 HP!\nThink you can beat me? Think you can defeat me with those stupid dice?
<0050> Th-that's way too much.
<0051> The crappiest game... ever.
<0052> That's right, Tomomo.\nThis fun little world of yours, I can easily destroy it by simply fiddling with my max HP value!
<0053> In your face! You deserve all this for creating this stupid game instead of hanging out with me!\nAha, ahahaha!
<0054> Now, try to knock me down, or the game will be over.
<0055> Come on, is that all you've got? Come and beat me!
<0056> Damn it... She's really going to destroy my world...
<0057> Ahahahaha!
<0058> I've got to do something...
<0059> Hey, did you know?
<0060> !?
<0061> Y-you...
<0062> This game has marked 1 million downloads.
<0063> And here's one other thing...
<0064> Protagonists always show up late... and win!
<0065> Poppooo!
<0066> Kai!
<0067> So you're the protagonist of this game? Your presence has been so weak, I didn't even realize you existed.
<0068> Hmph, say whatever you want while you still can.
<0069> I heard you say you've got 9999 HP.
<0070> Yes, so what? You saying you can beat me with your protagonist's privilege or something?\nNot a chance! You can only damage me using those dice.
<0071> There's no problem, then.
<0072> What...?
<0073> Like I told you, this game has been downloaded a million times...\nWhich means dice have also been rolled over a million times.
<0074> What are you... talking about?
<0075> QP! Suguri! Marc! I need you guys' help!
<0076> Yes!
<0077> Okay.
<0078> Of course.
<0079> Alright... Let's do this!
<0080> All the dice rolled by countless players so far... Come to me... Come to us...!!!
<0081> Yaaaaaah!
<0082> H-hold on a second.\nWhat are you trying to do!?\nYou people don't have the abilities to do something like that, do you...?
<0083> If four protagonists work together, they can make pretty much any kind of miracle happen.
<0084> You're making no seeeense!
<0085> Prepare yourself, Magical Devil...!
<0086> 9999? No...
<0087> This dice roll will be...
<0088> Over ONE MILLIOOOOOON!!!!!
<0089> GyaaaaaaaAAAAAAAA!!!!!
<0090> Look at the Magical Devil... She got knocked out so easily...
<0091> Holy crap... That's such a nasty thing to see...
<0092> I've never seen someone beat up so hard...
<0093> I'm actually feeling sorry for her now...
<0094> Pigeeeeeeee...!!
<0095> Mio... You were strong...\nLet's play fair and square next time...
<0096> Poppo.
<0097> U... Uuu...
<0098> I-I just wanted to... hang out with you, Tomomo...!
<0099> Mio...
<0100> You could've asked me without going too far like that...\nThat's why you don't have any friends...
<0101> You just overkilled me by telling me the truth!\nI can't believe you'd be so harsh, Tomomo!
<0102> Fueeen! Damn it, damn it!
<0103> Now you've left me no choice...\nI'll do whatever I can with all my remaining powers.
<0104> Why don't you give in already!?
<0105> Fu... Fufu... I just feel like being a little mean...!
<0106> To Tomomo... this world... and all of you players who did such a horrible thing to me!
<0107> What...?
<0108> Poppo!
<0109> Mio, no!
<0110> W-what the... The light... Uaaaah!
<0111> The moon looks beautiful...
<0112> Where are you... Mama?
