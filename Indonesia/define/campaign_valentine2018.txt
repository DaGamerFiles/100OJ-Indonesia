<0000> This day has finally come...\nThe day for us to choose the King from among ourselves.\nThe holy day called...
<0001> VALENTINE'S DAY!!!
<0002> Whoever seizes victory today will stand on the top among us Sweet Gods, and the rest must obey her...
<0003> Now, everyone! Let us fight each other for that glorious throne!
<0004> ...
<0005> ...
<0006> Um...
<0007> What is it, Sweet Guardian?
<0008> I still don't know why you called the three of us out here.
<0009> I believe I've just explained it.
<0010> Everything you said went over my head!!
<0011> For crying out loud... You're a dumb puppy as usual, Guardian.
<0012> Sorry, I didn't get it either.
<0013> I agree with Q being a dumb puppy, but I don't understand anything else at all, either!
<0014> Excuse me, Saki!!
<0015> *Tsk*. A gathering of fools...\nBy the way, where are Sweet Blogger and Sweet Creator?
<0016> They're not here.
<0017> They're not even in this game yet.
<0018> Hoeee, there must be complicated circumstances behind that.
<0019> Ugh... Oh well. All right then, it's just the four of us this year!\nOne of us will be the Sweet King!
<0020> What are we going to do exactly?
<0021> Today is Valentine's Day...\nIt's the day that proves which one of us is the Sweet God that people worship the most.
<0022> Does that mean...
<0023> Certainly! It's chocolate! The amount of chocolate people give you shows the amount of faith they put in you!
<0024> So we're going to compete to see who'll gather the most chocolate?
<0025> And whoever gets the most will be boss of the Sweet Gods?
<0026> King, not boss.
<0027> Haeee, now I get what you want to do with us...\nBut why did you decide on this now?
<0028> I thought it would be fun somehow.
<0029> Haee...
<0030> She calls us fools, but...
<0031> She deserves to be called that as well.
<0032> Silence.
<0033> Just so you know, there are ten kinds of sweets I find utterly dangerous, and I shall make them completely unobtainable if I am chosen as King.
<0034> What...
<0035> Is one of them pudding, by any chance...?
<0036> Of course it is.
<0037> HOEEEEEEEEE!!
<0038> You guys really love pudding.\nMy condolences.
<0039> Red bean ice cream too.
<0040> What the hell!?\nI can't turn into a magical girl without it!
<0041> Ku-ku-ku... If you want to stop me, one of the three of you must become King...
<0042> Ugh, I can't believe how diabolic she is...
<0043> With this stake, I have to give it my all... Time to go get a bunch of chocolate!
<0044> I-I must try my hardest too!!!\nWait a second.... Chocolate...?
<0045> I'm a dog!\nChocolate is something dogs have big, big trouble with...!!
<0046> A Sweet God who dares to claim they can't tolerate a sweet...\nI knew you weren't qualified to be one of us, Guardian.
<0047> Ugh, I have to do something, or the world will lose pudding... What should I do... Just what should I do?!
<0048> Wait, what's that I hear...?
<0049> Someone's calling to me from above... I know this voice... Is that you, <player>? Oh, I got it!
<0050> <player>! Can you please help me gather chocolate?!
<0051> I can't do it on my own! But I'm sure I'll be fine if it's with you...! We're going to shatter Sweet B's malicious plan!
<0052> Ugh... This can't be true...
<0053> How did Sweet B get all that chocolate? I thought she had no friends...
<0054> Ku-ku-ku! This is the power of worship! People have acknowledged my words and deeds as a god!!
<0055> I don't know what she's talking about... But now red bean ice cream will be gone...
<0056> And pudding too...\nOh, but where's QP...!?
<0057> Kufufufu! What could that dumb puppy possibly do!?\nThere is no way a dog like her can gather chocolate! Ahahaha!
<0058> D-devil...
<0059> I'm sorry, Q... I couldn't save... pudd-
<0060> Don't give up!
<0061> What the!?
<0062> Q-QP...!!!
<0063> Hah. Well, don't you seem cheerful.\nWitness the tremendous amount of chocolate I possess, and despair!
<0064> Heh...
<0065> What...? What is funny!?
<0066> You were right! I couldn't have done this on my own! Nobody would've given me chocolate!\nIt's dangerous to dogs!!! Even a Sweet God is no exception!!
<0067> However, I have someone!\nI have the best partner that believes in me!
<0068> I-is that...!?
<0069> <player>...!
<0070> I-it can't be, <player> is on Guardian's side...!?
<0071> Behold, Sweet Breaker!\nThis is our power!
<0072> What is happening? It's suddenly gotten dark around here...
<0073> Something's covering up the sun...\nIs that the moon...?
<0074> No, it's not!! It's...
<0075> Choco... late...?
<0076> Chocolate so big you'd mistake it for the moon...!? What kind of joke is this...? Even if you combined all the chocolate in the world, this size would be impossible!!
<0077> All the love from people around the world! All the love for sweets they have! It's all merged together and turned into this planet of chocolate!
<0078> That's ridiculous! It can't be true...
<0079> It is true! Because today is...
<0080> VALENTINE'S DAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!
<0081> Ha-hawawah...
<0082> Prepare yourself, Sweet B...!\nThis is the love for sweets... from me, <player>, and everyone around the world!!!!
<0083> CHOCOLATE MOON BUSTER!!!!
<0084> Faaaaaaaaaaah!!!
<0085> I won...
<0086> Sweet Guardian... you've completely defeated me.
<0087> Way to go, Q!
<0088> You're fantastic, Q!
<0089> From this day on, you are King of the Six Sweet Gods...\nYou will bear the future of the universe of sweets...
<0090> Okay! I don't really know what I'm supposed to do as King... but I got this! I'll protect the future of all sweets! Because I am Sweet Guardian!
<0091> But... I couldn't have won without someone.
<0092> <player>, you helped me protect what's important!\nThank you so much!
<0093> Okay, let me wrap this up. *Ahem*!
<0094> Since you helped me so much, I must give you something...\nHow should I put it... It's something like a token of my gratitude... Anyway!
<0095> I-I put all my love in this!\nPlease take it!
<0096> Happy Valentine's Day, <player>!
