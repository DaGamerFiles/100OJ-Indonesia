<0000> Help yourself to a die roll.
<0001> Let's see.
<0002> Would you like a die?
<0003> Here it rolls.
<0004> Is the order a card?
<0005> A card's about to be served.
<0006> We recommend this card.
<0007> Are you here for a card?
<0008> Here's a trap card.
<0009> This way, please!
<0010> Come this way!
<0011> This service includes a complimentary trap.
<0012> I'm going to play a battle card now.
<0013> This will make our work easier.
<0014> I'm ready to work my hardest!
<0015> This is a battle card, huh? I see, I see...!
<0016> That was a good break!
<0017> My break is over now!
<0018> Alright, I'm going to work hard!
<0019> I'll work with a smile.
<0020> I think it's okay to extend my break a little...
<0021> Fuee, I could use a little more rest...
<0022> Maybe I overworked myself a little bit...
<0023> Mhm, I'm feeling heavy.
<0024> Attaaack!
<0025> Eey!
<0026> Welcome to our restaurant!
<0027> A wet hand towel and a glass of cold water...!
<0028> Ouch!
<0029> Why would you do that to me?!
<0030> Please!
<0031> Would you knock that off!
<0032> Ah, I like this.
<0033> This helps a lot!
<0034> Haah, I'm feeling better now.
<0035> That's real nice.
<0036> Wa-wa-wah!
<0037> Nooo!
<0038> Whoa, I'm gonna drop the dish!
<0039> I don't like this!
<0040> Ugh, I think I'm tired...
<0041> Could it be... I'm burned out...
<0042> Ow, my back!
<0043> Kyuu...
<0044> Someone else is going to fight in my stead!
<0045> This is where he comes in.
<0046> Oh no, help me!
<0047> I'll warn you: He's very strong!
<0048> Nooo, I'm just a part-time worker!
<0049> I'm going to have to ask you to behave, customer!
<0050> Excuse me, that kind of stuff is not allowed here.
<0051> Heeen!
<0052> Yah!
<0053> Take his attack!
<0054> Slap!
<0055> Eeey!
<0056> Ueeh!
<0057> Wait, wait!
<0058> Please cut that out!
<0059> Awawah!
<0060> That makes us very uncomfortable, customer!
<0061> Whoa, this is bad!
<0062> How could you do such a horrible thing!?
<0063> I'll call the police on you! Geez!
<0064> Wa-wa-wah!
<0065> That was close! So close!
<0066> Please behave!
<0067> That almost hit me, geez!
<0068> I appreciate the victory!
<0069> Yaaay!
<0070> Please come back to our restaurant soon.
<0071> Phew, we did a great job here.
<0072> Oh no...
<0073> We're worn out...
<0074> Ugh... Maybe I should quit this job...
<0075> This is cruel!
<0076> Is this a bonus for me!?
<0077> Yes, I got paid!
<0078> This is what I work for!
<0079> Wahah! This is the best!
<0080> Huh? Huh? This doesn't mean I'll get paid less, right...?
<0081> Hey, that's my bonus!
<0082> My reason to work!
<0083> Pieeen!
<0084> Why would anyone put this down here?!
<0085> Fue! Please!
<0086> Is this even allowed?!
<0087> I fell for a trap!?
<0088> Um, something's wrong here.
<0089> Mhm, there's someone here.
<0090> I dare say... this is not a easy customer to deal with...?
<0091> Fuee! I'm very scared!
<0092> For the sake of getting paid more!
<0093> Bonus pay!? Who wouldn't want that!
<0094> I'll go make myself rich!
<0095> Make sure to add these to my pay!
<0096> I-I don't mind if someone else does the fighting.
<0097> What? Who's going to do the fighting?
<0098> Fighting? That's something I can't do...
<0099> I'm going to have to ask Manager or Chef for help.
<0100> I'm Chris! Welcome to Pures!
<0101> My recommendation? That'd be the Bunny Hamburg!
<0102> I'll work hard as usual!
<0103> Work! Work!
<0104> Welcome to Pures!
<0105> I'm so fired up for work!
<0106> Alright, let me punch in my time card.
<0107> Let's try our hardest!
<0108> Thank you for coming to our restaurant!
<0109> I sure did get a bunch of work done again~.
<0110> Alright, I'm finally off work!
<0111> Good work, everyone!
<0112> Is that the order?
<0113> That's one of our recommendations!
<0114> Would you like this one as well?
<0115> Thank you for ordering with us!
<0116> Yeees.
<0117> That's nice.
<0118> Certainly!
<0119> I'm afraid I'm not able to do that...
<0120> Mhm, I'm feeling heavy.
<0121> You're in luck!
<0122> Well... Mhm.
<0123> Alright then, let's get working.
<0124> Dice time!
<0125> I'm rooting for you!
<0126> Good morning!
<0127> What should I do? ...Mhm.
<0128> Congratulations!
<0129> That's amazing! Congratulations!
<0130> W-why!
<0131> Oh, I don't know this menu item.
<0132> Has this always been on the menu?
<0133> Well... Is it okay to... use this?
<0134> I'm told to use whatever I can!
<0135> What!? Manager!?
<0136> H-how come Manager's here!?
<0137> Manager, did you just get to work?
<0138> Oh no... Manager looks angry.
<0139> What!? Did I screw something up!?
<0140> Manager... You're m-mad, aren't you?
<0141> We shouldn't do this, Manager!
<0142> W-why are you approaching me!
<0143> Chef! I need your support here!
<0144> Chef, maybe a knife isn't a good idea...
<0145> Chef, it's time to show your skills!
<0146> Chef, I'm counting on you!
<0147> Manager, I could use some help!
<0148> Once Manager steps out... nobody can stop him!
<0149> Now that Manager's come out here, victory is ours!
<0150> Manager! Please don't overdo it!
<0151> Cheeef!!!
<0152> What? Chef's knocked out...!?
<0153> Oh nooo, Chef!
<0154> Are you okay...? You'd better take a break.
<0155> M-Manager... is defeated...?
<0156> Oh no... Manager, no...!
<0157> Manager, you have to wake up, Manager!
<0158> Manageeeeeer!!!
