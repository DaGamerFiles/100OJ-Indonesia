<0000> KAAACK!
<0001> W-what's with that chicken! It's huge!
<0002> Oh my, it sure is. It'd make a good jumbo-sized fried chicken.
<0003> I'm sure you could actually cook it...
<0004> Oh no, we shouldn't be chitchatting! Look.
<0005> KAAACK!!
<0006> I-it's going to wreck the town.
<0007> That'll be big trouble. What are we going to do?
<0008> We work hard together and take it down... maybe? But it's too big for just the two of us to handle...
<0009> Don't worry. It's not just the two of you.
<0010> Suguri!
<0011> Let's all work together.
<0012> Marc, you too! You guys came to help us! *Cry*
<0013> There, there.
<0014> Relax, QP.
<0015> *Sob* Thanks so much, guys.
<0016> All right! With the four of us, beating that chicken will be a walk in the park.
<0017> ...If we're only facing that chicken, that is.
<0018> Huh?
<0019> GWWWW!
<0020> POPPOPPO!!!
<0021> What the heck!! Where did those other giants come from!
<0022> They weren't here until just a moment ago...
<0023> Maybe they teleported here from someplace else? Or maybe they grew that enormous all of a sudden?
<0024> Is that even possible?
<0025> I don't know how it happened, but before we try to figure it out...
<0026> We have to stop all of them!
<0027> That's right!
<0028> Boy, I'm so worn out.
<0029> Great work, Q. I'll buy you a pudding as a reward. A pudding as big as the chicken we took down.
<0030> Hooray!!
<0031> I'm relieved we managed to work everything out... But we still don't know who or what caused all that.
<0032> Someone who can do crazy stuff like that... I do have one person in mind.
<0033> Of course, who else could it be but her... She really keeps doing crazy things, huh.
<0034> Ah, it's her, isn't it? She's such a troublemaker.
<0035> She really is...
<0036> It seems everyone knows who the culprit is. All right then...
<0037> Why don't we go teach that someone a little lesson right now?
<0038> *Shivers*
<0039> Huh, they took down all of my giants...
<0040> I've got to hand it to you, this world's quite fun, Tomomo.
<0041> Ugh... This is my world. You can't just do whatever you please here...
<0042> Fufufu, if it's yours, I have the right to enjoy it in whatever manner I see fit, don't I?
<0043> Because I'm your mama.
