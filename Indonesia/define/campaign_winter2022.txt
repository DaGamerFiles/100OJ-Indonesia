// (mio)
<0000> Fufufu, I nailed it. I know Tomomo will like it ♥

// (sweetcreator)
<0001> Everyone, merry Christmas! And cheers!

// (othersweetgods)
<0002> Cheers!

// (natsumi)
<0003> A Sweet Gods Christmas party, it's so much fun.

// (saki)
<0004> I want you all to enjoy the Christmas cookies that I baked!

// (natsumi)
<0005> I brought home-made pudding crepes. They're really good.

// (qp)
<0006> Pudding crepes!? Natsumi, I'll respect you for the rest of my life!!!

// (tomomo)
<0007> Everything looks so good! Wait a sec, where's the Christmas cake?

// (sweetcreator)
<0008> I believe Sweet Breaker was in charge of it.

// (sweetbreaker)
<0009> I tried to make one myself but it didn't go well. I'm sorry...

// (saki)
<0010> Well, Sweebo is better at destroying or sealing off sweets than making them.

// (qp)
<0011> That reminds me of my dream from the other night where she tried to make pudding disappear from the world and I stopped her.

// (sweetbreaker)
<0012> You two are being very blunt, aren't you? Also, could you not call me Sweebo?

// (natsumi)
<0013> That's no biggie. We can make one here and now.

// (mio)
<0014> Tomomooo ♥

// (tomomo)
<0015> Mio!? What the heck are you doing breaking into someone's house!

// (mio)
<0016> I baked a Christmas cake. Let's eat it ♥

// (sweetbreaker)
<0017> That's perfect timing. I suggest we gratefully accept her kind offer.

// (sweetcreator)
<0018> Seems like we attracted a cake... Our divine power did it again!

// (natsumi)
<0019> Mio, you can sit over here.

// (tomomo)
<0020> Well, guess I'll let you join us for the cake.

// (mio)
<0021> Hooray ♥

// (allsweetgods)
<0022> Let's dig in! *Bite* ...Ugh.

// (mio)
<0023> It's delicious, isn't it? As a sweets lover, I put a lot of effort into it ♥

// (sweetcreator)
<0024> Are you truly a sweets lover...?

// (sweetbreaker)
<0025> I-is this thing really cake...?

// (natsumi&saki&qp)
<0026> ......

// (tomomo)
<0027> What the heck! This is disgusting!

// (mio)
<0028> No way, you've got to be kidding me!? ...*Bite*... Hey, it's tasty!

// (saki)
<0029> It does look like a chocolate cake, but...

// (natsumi)
<0030> It doesn't taste like the way it looks, I'd say.

// (mio)
<0031> How could you not appreciate my delicious cake? What kind of cakes do you eat?

// (tomomo)
<0032> Ones that don't taste like garbage.

// (mio)
<0033> You called it garbage again! I'm so mad right now! Okay, I know what I'm going to do...

// (mio)
<0034> I'm using my magic power to make a lot of cakes and swap all the cakes out there with them! I'll prove my cakes are better than any other!

// (tomomo)
<0035> Oh, so you're not gonna turn things gigantic this time, huh. ...Wait a minute, what the heck did you just say you would do!?

// (sweetcreator)
<0036> Mio, was it? We can't let what you just said pass.

// (sweetbreaker)
<0037> If you're going to pose a threat to the order of sweets, we have to stand against you.

// (qp)
<0038> We, the Sweet Gods, will protect the Christmas cakes all over the world!

// (saki)
<0039> This crisis of sweets is making me so super pumped up!!!

// (natsumi)
<0040> All right, I'll do everything I can for the cakes.

// (mio)
<0041> That's lovely. Bring it on, all of you. Nobody can stop me when I'm furious ♥

// ========= Scene:  Ending 2 (Mio wins) =========

// (mio)
<0053> Ufufu, I won ♥ I told you nobody can stop me when I'm angry.

// (sweeteater)
<0054> How could people actually like that terrible cake more than a real one!?

// (sweetguardian)
<0055> Actually, I just ate some of it again and it's not as bad as I first thought.

// (sweetblogger)
<0056> Tons of sweets bloggers are writing about the cake. It's the new trend now.

// (sweetcreator)
<0057> It seems that the world of sweets is deeper than I knew. There's still much for me to learn.

// (sweetbreaker)
<0058> I guess that's right. We shouldn't have been so hasty in deciding that the cake is objectively bad.

// (sweetmaker)
<0059> Mio, could you teach me how to make that cake? As a patissier, I believe I need to learn the recipe!

// (mio)
<0060> Of course ♥

// (sweetcreator)
<0061> Alright, we're going to get back to my place and make some cake!

// (everyone)
<0062> Yeah!

// (sweeteater)
<0063> Hey, hey, heeey! Wait up! Don't leave me alone here!
