<0000> We're on the beach!
<0001> *Woosh*!
<0002> It tastes salty! Wheee!
<0003> Oh boy, look at her go.
<0004> I can't believe she's acting as giddy as a little child...
<0005> But, seeing her that happy makes it well worth having brought her all the way here.
<0006> I would have liked to enjoy the beach in a little more serene setting, though.
<0007> You know, since I rarely get a chance like this to spend time at the beach with you.
<0008> Yeah, we don't usually see the sea from the ground level.
<0009> *Sigh*... You can be so...!
<0010> Huh, what?
<0011> Forget it.
<0012> You know what? The sea feels much more calm and quiet down here than up there. We don't get assaulted by all those scary seagulls, for one.
<0013> I think... you might be wrong about that.
<0014> Huh?
<0015> Squaawk!
<0016> Aargh! What's with you birds!
<0017> Oh no. They're attacking her! A-are you okay, QP!?
<0018> I'm fiiine! My summer hype makes me invincible! Yaaaaaah!
<0019> Squawk!!!
<0020> She seems to be having fun over there. We should enjoy ourselves too.
<0021> Okay... I just hope nothing bad will happen to her.
<0022> (A few hours later...)
<0023> It feels weird, you know? Floating in water. It's completely different from flying in the air.
<0024> You always talk about the skies... You know what they call people like you? A workaholic.
<0025> It's a good thing to have work to do.
<0026> That's not what I meant. What I'm saying is... Why don't you try to have more fun when you're not at work?
<0027> I'm having fun right now. Fun with the beach. Fun talking with you.
<0028> Sometimes... I just don't get you.
<0029> By the way... where did QP go?
<0030> I saw her playing with the seagulls a while ago, but I don't hear them now...
<0031> Squ... aawk...
<0032> Oh, there's a seagull here.
<0033> Squaaawk!!
<0034> Eek! W-what's wrong with it?
<0035> Fu-fu-fu, I wouldn't be so relaxed if I were you.
<0036> Because the summertime beach is full of perils!
<0037> QP... Wait, what happened to you!? You're insanely tanned!
<0038> And what's with all those seagulls around you?!
<0039> Ku-ku-ku... They're serving me now!
<0040> Squaawk!
<0041> S-serving you?
<0042> Listen up, you two! We, the QP Corps, won't let you just chill on the beach in the summer!
<0043> If you want your peaceful beach back, you have to hang out with me all I want!
<0044> You're not making any sense, QP.
<0045> It seems that her summer hype has driven her bonkers.
<0046> Now, you guys better get yourselves ready!!
<0047> Ueeeeee! I want to play a whole lot more!
<0048> Haha, looks like you still have plenty of energy left.
<0049> I'm exhausted.
<0050> Same... How about some snacks now?
<0051> Sure, I would love that.
<0052> QP, you want to get some snacks with us?
<0053> I don't wanna waste even a second! I'm gonna play with the seagulls!
<0054> Got it. Okay then, it'll just be the two of us.
<0055> All right. That's too bad, though. I brought this just for her.
<0056> Wow, it's pudding.
<0057> P-pudding...?
<0058> Aw, sweets sure taste all the sweeter after a work-out.
<0059> You're right. Mine tastes better than usual, too.
<0060> P-pudding that's better than usual...!?
<0061> Fufu. This makes all the time and effort that we spent on QP totally worth it.
<0062> Pudding that got better because of me!?
<0063> H-hang on! I-I want it, too! Pudding! Puddiiing!
<0064> Don't worry, QP. You don't need to hurry! We have some for you too.
<0065> She never stops being loud... Well, it's not that I'm saying it's a bad thing.
<0066> Yeah, it's been so much fun today!
<0067> Fernet, we should make sure to come back here again.
