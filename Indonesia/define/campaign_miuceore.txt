<0000> Hmm... What should Repa do?
<0001> Hey, Repa.\nYou look like something's bothering you. What's up?
<0002> ...Here comes the noisy one.
<0003> Huh? Noisy?\nAre you praising me?
<0004> ...*Sigh*.\nRepa thinks you should learn some self-awareness.
<0005> Being full of energy is my charm point.
<0006> That's not something you're supposed to say about yourself.
<0007> Anyway, back to the original topic...\nYou look troubled. What is it? Maybe I can help you out.
<0008> It's okay. Repa's fine...\nJust leave Repa alone, please...
<0009> Come on, don't be so hard on me...\nAs fellow magical girls, we should be nice to each other.
<0010> I really want to up my Girl Power together with youuu.\nPweaaase. I've got nothing to do...
<0011> *Sigh*. You just want to escape boredom, huh... But on second thought... Perhaps you can actually help. Miu, you may give Repa a hand.
<0012> Sure, of course! I can give you a hand! Yes! Okay!\nWhat will it be? A date? Holding hands? Or perhaps a K-I-S-S?
<0013> That's not what Repa meant...\nGet your face away from mine.
<0014> Ehehe, I'm just kidding around.\nSo, what do you need me to do for you?
<0015> Play a little game with Repa.
<0016> A game?
<0017> It's called a board game.\nRepa borrowed it from the Forest Witch.
<0018> She explained that it's more fun to play it with other people...\nHence, Repa shall grant you the privilege of playing it with her.
<0019> I see. She has weird taste huh, having stuff like that.
<0020> She also told Repa that the souls of many legendary girls dwell within this game.
<0021> Who are those girls?
<0022> They were girls who raised their GP... to a horrifying degree.
<0023> That's why...\nPlaying this game has to give Repa's GP a huge boost, too.
<0024> Wow, that sounds like a blast! Let's do it right away!
<0025> I see you are as excited as Repa is.\nAll right then, let's begin.
<0026> Boy, this game is quite challenging.\nI didn't feel a lot of GP in those two, though.
<0027> Open your eyes, Miu.\nIndividually, those two girls didn't have much GP, yet Repa could sense an explosive amount of it when they were together.
<0028> Is that the rumored CGP (Coupling Girl Power)...?\nAre you saying it's an aspect of Girl Power that we've never seen?
<0029> That's correct.\nCGP... Repa has a feeling that our GP has also gone up from learning of it.
<0030> That's awesome...! I guess we just caught a small glimpse of this game's greatness...\nHey, we should play more!
<0031> Of course.\nNow, we're moving onto the next match.
<0032> Howaah... What were those cute creatures exactly?\nDo you think they were actually girls?
<0033> Repa almost lost her mind, too.\nThey were extremely cute...
<0034> Although, that cuteness didn't really feel like Girl Power.
<0035> Cuteness... It is something required to improve one's GP.\nAn excess of cuteness, however, takes its owner somewhere beyond the concept of a "girl."
<0036> OverCute, huh...\nWe must be careful not to let it happen to us.
<0037> This game seems to teach valuable lessons...\nThat's just sparked Repa's interest in it that much more.
<0038> Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
<0039> Yes.\nLet's get to the next match already.
<0040> You know what? I can really relate to the girls we just fought.\nEnergetic girls sure are cute, aren't they?
<0041> That's correct. They seemed a type similar to you... But you appear to be overlooking a more important aspect of them.
<0042> What?
<0043> It's what they were wearing. It was simple yet fluttery.\nRepa couldn't help but feel some sort of ultimate power, as though it were something that has been passed down for hundreds of years.
<0044> I agree... That outfit had some kind of aura about it.
<0045> Dressing up is one of the basics to raise your GP.\nThose costumes made Repa see a massive potential. They would look gorgeous on any girl out there.
<0046> Say, does that mean I would look amazing in one, too?
<0047> A terrifying thing to imagine, but Repa would wager it's true.\nRepa must say, those outfits were nothing short of miraculous.
<0048> Hooray! I've got to have the Forest Witch make one for me.
<0049> Oh, not so fast.\nRepa wants one too.
<0050> Okay then, why don't we go visit her together?
<0051> ...Repa will think about it.\nFor now, we're playing this game until we get bored to death.
<0052> Elegance. That's literally the only word Repa can think of.
<0053> I wouldn't be able to pull that off, no matter how I tried...\nI'm starting to lose heart.
<0054> It'd certainly be impossible for you, Miu.\nEach action of those two girls was quiet and graceful.
<0055> I bet that's something they've honed since they were small.
<0056> Repa thinks you are right.\nThey are in a place you can only reach by continuous effort ever since you become able to reason.
<0057> Uugh. Now I'm starting to feel scared of playing this game...
<0058> We've already come too far to quit now.
<0059> I know... Feeling down won't help us become cuter!\nWe're moving on!
<0060> That felt like a pair of really hardworking girls.
<0061> Repa wasn't expecting to see girls like them at this point.\nHardworking girls sure can be cute.
<0062> I agree. I think Rone is just as hardworking, and she looks so cute when she's doing her best.
<0063> Repa would say she mostly considers what she does a hobby...\nAnyhow, those girls from earlier felt like they had an inner shine.
<0064> I think I know why.\nI bet they have a dream.
<0065> A dream?\nThey weren't asleep during the game, though.
<0066> That's not the type of dream I'm talking about...\n...Jeez, don't make me explain. That would be a little embarrassing.
<0067> You got Repa interested now Miu, so you owe her an explanation.
<0068> Come on, let's go to the next stage!
<0069> But Repa needs you to explain...
<0070> There were... sweet smells everywhere...
<0071> I never saw most of those sweets before in my life.
<0072> They seemed to have been made by those girls.
<0073> Making sweets, huh... That's one of the Girl Power basics. The better you can make them, the more praise you get, so you should pursue the highest grade sweets!\nThat's the feeling I got from them.
<0074> You are absolutely correct.\nRepa especially loved that wobbly one. It was just amazing.
<0075> I believe they called it "pudding."\nI already miss it. I want to have a lot more...
<0076> Repa too... Wait!
<0077> What's wrong?
<0078> Sweets are indeed great.\nBut imagine what will happen if you eat too many of them.
<0079> Well, your tummy will swell and your cheeks will puff up...\nAaaaaaah!?
<0080> If you turn round, your GP will decrease dramatically.
<0081> Are you saying making sweets not only raises your own GP but doubles as a wicked weapon... that poisons other girls' GP?
<0082> *Shiver*... Repa's impressed.\nWe just learned... a new technique of simultaneous defense and offense.
<0083> Oh man... I keep being amazed.
<0084> That just proves how great the souls living in this game are.\nWe'd better not make light of the Forest Witch.
<0085> I can't wait to see the next girls.
<0086> Adult women...
<0087> Working women...
<0088> Repa admits neither of their GP was remarkably high, but...
<0089> They were both stunning.
<0090> Normal girls must keep growing attractive even after passing the prime of their GP.
<0091> That makes sense... Do you think we'll be like them some day?
<0092> Repa wonders.\nYou know, with us staying young girls forever, and all.
<0093> That's right... that's exactly why we're working so hard to raise our GP.
<0094> Are you feeling down?
<0095> Yeah... But well, this has been a lot of fun, so I'll be fine!
<0096> You're so positive...\nNow, let's keep playing.
<0097> Sure!
<0098> We got grown women as our opponents twice in a row.
<0099> They appeared as cool as cucumbers.\nThey must be the kind of people who have a firm grasp on things.
<0100> I know that feeling.\nBut, you know... I felt like there was something different between them and the girls before them.
<0101> It's that, isn't it? Sex appeal.
<0102> Sex appeal!! Oh man, that's one thing that's totally out of my reach.
<0103> Repa doesn't have any, either...
<0104> You know what? Being a grown-up really is amazing.
<0105> Repa thinks you're right.\nBut...
<0106> What?
<0107> Even if you could actually become a grown-up,\nyou probably still wouldn't have any sex appeal.
<0108> Why would you say that!?
<0109> Anyhow, it seems like this game is going to be over soon.
<0110> Oh yeah? Okay then, let's get to the end real quick.
<0111> Let's do it.
<0112> That was...
<0113> Weird.\nThat weirdly costumed girl aside,\nthat nurse lady had a pretty stunning body, but...
<0114> Having a nice body is kind of an inborn trait. And if she can maintain it, she should have a huge reserve of GP no matter what guise she's in.
<0115> Plus, women with a hot body like hers should be super stylish...\nDespite all that...!
<0116> Neither of those two girls felt like they had an ounce of GP in them.
<0117> They were... a terrifying thing to witness.\nRepa's certain they must be on the verge of becoming Girls of Death.
<0118> G.O.D...! The demise of witches...\nBut why?
<0119> Repa has no idea.\nAlthough, one thing that's for certain is...
<0120> We can't let ourselves become like them, right?
<0121> *Nod*.
<0122> Repa... I'm getting scared.
<0123> So is Repa.\nBut...
<0124> Are we going to keep going?
<0125> The game is filling Repa with dread now. But the next match is the final one... Would you come along with Repa?
<0126> If you've made up your mind, I've got no choice but to do the same!
<0127> Miu... Thank you.
<0128> Alright then, the last...\nOh no!!
<0129> What's happening...? We haven't even started yet.\nThere's an enormous aura...\na raging storm of Girl Power!!
<0130> I've never felt Girl Power as strong as this...!\nWhat kind of girls can they be?!
<0131> Idols...
<0132> Idols...
<0133> They were nothing but a chunk of raw GP.
<0134> Yeah... Just amazing... I don't know what else to say.
<0135> Miusaki, are you crying?
<0136> What...? Oh, yeah, looks like I am.\nMaybe I was moved...\nRepa, you're crying too.
<0137> This can't be happening.\nTears are streaming from Repa's eyes on their own.
<0138> Ahaha. I think these tears prove just how wonderful the girls we met were.
<0139> Yes, but not only those two.\nEach and every one of the girls that showed up in this game touched Repa's heart in different ways.
<0140> Same here.\nAnd there's something I want to tell you.
<0141> What is it?
<0142> I agree the girls in this game were all cute and all,\nbut you're just as cute as them.
<0143> You're flattering Repa...\nBut that does make Repa a little happy...
<0144> Well, since you said that much...\nRepa must confess that she thinks you're a little bit cute too.
<0145> Thanks!
<0146> Alright then, it's time to go.\nMiusaki, come with Repa.
<0147> Ah, going to return the game to the Forest Witch?
<0148> Yes, and...
<0149> Mmm, it's so good!\nI didn't know the forest witch could make pudding.
<0150> This is it.\nThis is the costume Repa needed.\nIt even looks nice on Miu.
<0151> You look great in it too! So cuuuute!
<0152> You two are making so much noise. Jeez.
<0153> Yes, and it's rare seeing you two together.\nSo you two played it, huh?
<0154> We did. It was splendid. Repa's a major fan now.\nYou should play it with us.
<0155> Sure. Well, we need one more player... Should we get Rone?
<0156> Good idea. Let's have a ton of fun!
