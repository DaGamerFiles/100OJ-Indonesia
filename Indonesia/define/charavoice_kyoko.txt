<0000> Okay.
<0001> Here.
<0002> There.
<0003> *Sigh*...
<0004> I suppose I'll go with this.
<0005> I'm playing this card.
<0006> What a pain in the neck.
<0007> I'll use a card.
<0008> Here's a trap.
<0009> I'm setting this here.
<0010> I wonder if anyone will fall into this.
<0011> This seems like a good trap spot.
<0012> This will make things easier for me.
<0013> It's time to reverse the situation.
<0014> Losing would be troublesome... so.
<0015> Here, I'm going to use this.
<0016> Barrier.
<0017> *Tsk*... What a drag.
<0018> I have so much dust on my clothes.
<0019> Don't forget about my fragile health.
<0020> I suppose I'll go get some more work done.
<0021> I'm sick of being in bad shape.
<0022> This is a great annoyance.
<0023> I don't want to push myself.
<0024> Ugh...
<0025> I'm not a good attacker, though.
<0026> A good chance to strike.
<0027> Crystal.
<0028> My apologies.
<0029> Ugh...
<0030> Why make this a bigger struggle for me?
<0031> Guh.
<0032> Argh.
<0033> I feel a little better now.
<0034> I like this.
<0035> I shouldn't try too hard.
<0036> I take this... to mean that I have to work more.
<0037> Warp?
<0038> Where will you send me over?
<0039> This isn't a safe way of travelling.
<0040> Don't shock me like this.
<0041> I can take a breather... it seems.
<0042> For goodness' sake...
<0043> I'm such a piece of junk.
<0044> *Tsk*... This is too much of a hassle.
<0045> I suggest you put your guard up.
<0046> I'll come at you.
<0047> I won't miss a chance to beat my enemies.
<0048> You're completely open to attack.
<0049> I'm very confident in my defense.
<0050> I'm not easy to damage.
<0051> Let's see if you can destroy my barrier.
<0052> Your attack won't make it through to me.
<0053> Make a crystal and throw it...
<0054> I'll show you my crystal.
<0055> This will pierce you.
<0056> This will stab you painfully.
<0057> Ugh.
<0058> Guh.
<0059> Auh.
<0060> Uu...
<0061> Guh, what a drag.
<0062> Go easy on me.
<0063> Unbelievable.
<0064> My body won't make it.
<0065> Thank goodness, it worked out.
<0066> Let's not be too reckless, you and I.
<0067> You should stay put for some time.
<0068> Phew, I somehow managed to win.
<0069> You defeated me.
<0070> This is as far as I could get...
<0071> My body... It's so useless.
<0072> I went overboard.
<0073> I'll take these.
<0074> I need to gather these, don't I?
<0075> I'll make the most of these.
<0076> What a pleasure.
<0077> I dropped some of them.
<0078> I lost some of them.
<0079> Oh dear...
<0080> I was careless.
<0081> A trap...?
<0082> I can't believe I fell into something like this.
<0083> Well set.
<0084> The trap caught me.
<0085> I have a bad feeling.
<0086> Here comes a nuisance.
<0087> I'd rather stay away from that.
<0088> Dealing with that will be so much work.
<0089> This option seems easier than the other one.
<0090> I hope I can get many of them easily.
<0091> I'm supposed to gather stars, aren't I?
<0092> I'll gather stars.
<0093> *Sigh*... I have no choice.
<0094> I'm not an aggressive attacker, but...
<0095> Beating them seems to be the only choice for me.
<0096> If fighting is the only way left for me...
<0097> I'm Kyoko.
<0098> Me? I don't mind hanging out with you for a bit.
<0099> What a pain.
<0100> I should probably get in some exercise once in a while.
<0101> Let's get this over with.
<0102> How should I move?
<0103> It started.
<0104> I'll do the best I can.
<0105> It turned out better than I thought.
<0106> Surprisingly enough, I won.
<0107> I won the game? Okay.
<0108> It's not bad, doing this sort of thing every once in a while.
<0109> Make sure not to spend too much.
<0110> Did you get what you wanted?
<0111> Good for you.
<0112> Is that thing useful?
<0113> Good.
<0114> Nice.
<0115> Yes.
<0116> No.
<0117> That's too bad.
<0118> Good for you.
<0119> Oh?
<0120> Let's go, shall we?
<0121> Go ahead and throw the dice.
<0122> Now.
<0123> Hello.
<0124> Hm...
<0125> Well done.
<0126> That's astonishing.
<0127> Don't do that.
<0128> I'm unfamiliar with this... IÅ'm worried.
<0129> I don't know whose this is, but allow me to use it.
<0130> This is a nice find.
<0131> What if I play this one?
<0132> Hm... It seems he's out here now.
<0133> *Sigh*... This'll be a hard fight for me.
<0134> I just want him to stay still forever.
<0135> Aw, jeez... He's such a piece of work.
<0136> Are you...
<0137> I don't really wanna be around you.
<0138> Hopefully we'll never see each other again.
<0139> You're hard for me to fight...  Really.
<0140> Why are you here...!
<0141> I'll reduce you to a head again.
<0142> You're disgusting...
<0143> You look better as a head.
<0144> I don't believe I lost to you of all others.
<0145> This is a nightmare... The worst nightmare ever.
<0146> Iru, I think you should act more calmly.
<0147> How are your bits?
<0148> You look like you're having fun... That's good.
<0149> You look... well. I have nothing to say if you're keeping healthy.
<0150> That's nothing to me.
<0151> You're not powerful enough to break my crystal.
