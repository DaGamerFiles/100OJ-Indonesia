<0000> Okay, fine.
<0001> Hmph.
<0002> There.
<0003> Yoh.
<0004> This is it.
<0005> It's okay to use this, right?
<0006> I'm gonna play this one.
<0007> I choose this card.
<0008> Careful.
<0009> I'm gonna put this down here.
<0010> Who'd walk into this?
<0011> This may or may not help.
<0012> Don't be so surprised.
<0013> I'll use this now.
<0014> I'm going to show you something special!
<0015> I'll go all out.
<0016> I'll put an end to this.
<0017> I'm up again. Let's go.
<0018> Restarting's done.
<0019> Everything's fixed now.
<0020> Time to make up for the loss.
<0021> I don't have time to waste.
<0022> C'mon.
<0023> Can't I still get up?
<0024> I have to wait more?
<0025> How's that!
<0026> Take that!
<0027> Go!
<0028> Get ready!
<0029> Ugh!
<0030> Guh!
<0031> That hurts.
<0032> What just hit me!?
<0033> Let me repair you.
<0034> I'll give you first aid.
<0035> Keep going, please.
<0036> This is a big help.
<0037> What the heck is this?
<0038> I'm facing some turbulence.
<0039> Where are you taking me?
<0040> What's going on here?
<0041> I got beaten.
<0042> I just made a painful mistake.
<0043> Can't hold out anymore!
<0044> I'm done for.
<0045> I have no choice but combat.
<0046> I'll be the one to start attacking.
<0047> Outta my way.
<0048> I'll kick your ass.
<0049> Alright, come at me.
<0050> What a big pain.
<0051> Don't you regret this.
<0052> You got some nerve to challenge me.
<0053> I'll shoot you down!
<0054> Eat that!
<0055> You're done for!
<0056> Accept defeat!
<0057> Kuh!
<0058> That hurts.
<0059> How dare you.
<0060> I got hit.
<0061> Guah!
<0062> I'm screwed!
<0063> Oh, shoot!
<0064> Direct hit!
<0065> Mhm.
<0066> That was close.
<0067> You can't hit me.
<0068> I could see that coming.
<0069> Don't hate the players.
<0070> See ya.
<0071> Come back to me when you're stronger.
<0072> You were such a piece of work.
<0073> What a bust.
<0074> You're in trouble now.
<0075> You did better than I thought.
<0076> Should've been more careful.
<0077> Good.
<0078> Nice.
<0079> Not bad.
<0080> I'll take these.
<0081> Oh well.
<0082> Fine.
<0083> I get it, I get it.
<0084> What the?
<0085> *Tsk*!
<0086> I messed up.
<0087> Oh, you're in for it now.
<0088> I'm so mad now.
<0089> I'm already having enough trouble.
<0090> What now?
<0091> I'll deal with you if that gives me a bonus.
<0092> Bigger isn't always better.
<0093> I choose stars.
<0094> Stars.
<0095> Guess I'll go with stars.
<0096> Hope I can get a lot of them easily.
<0097> Really, I do enough of this at work.
<0098> How many more am I supposed to shoot down?
<0099> If that's what I've gotta do, that's what I've gotta do.
<0100> What's the easy way to  get this done?
<0101> I have no choice... I guess.
<0102> If I get to fly... I guess it's okay.
<0103> Me...? Oh, man.
<0104> What a pain in the butt.
<0105> Alright, let's get started already.
<0106> Let's get this over with.
<0107> Okay, let's do this.
<0108> Bitching won't get me anywhere.
<0109> What a joke that was.
<0110> Looking forward to the bonus for my victory.
<0111> It's over now, huh... What a day.
<0112> How about some cheers for me?
<0113> I'll take that.
<0114> Never seen this one.
<0115> We got something new.
<0116> Looks like we didn't have that yet.
<0117> Okay.
<0118> Not bad.
<0119> Sure.
<0120> Nope.
<0121> No.
<0122> Whoa.
<0123> Huh?
<0124> Guess it's time to go...
<0125> Here goes.
<0126> Let's go.
<0127> Yo.
<0128> Oh, man.
<0129> Nice.
<0130> Awesome.
<0131> Huh!
<0132> How's this even possible!?
<0133> Guess using this is better than losing.
<0134> Don't say this isn't fair.
<0135> It's okay to use this, right?
<0136> Bring it. I'm not going easy on you.
<0137> You're going down.
<0138> Don't bother her too much, okay?
<0139> I've wanted to fight you once.
<0140> Amuse me.
<0141> This'll make me look like a bully, won't it?
<0142> I'll straighten you up.
<0143> I'll destroy you to make my way forward.
<0144> No more trouble between us, okay?
<0145> Nothing's more ridiculous than this.
<0146> Get any closer and you'll regret it.
<0147> Great, how much is that worth?
<0148> Cuz I can't stand draws.
<0149> I don't remember getting equipped with this.
<0150> I don't need any trouble.
<0151> I don't want to be like her... but I feel like doing this now.
<0152> Please don't hit me.
<0153> Hope this doesn't jinx me.
<0154> No hard feelings.
<0155> Man, what an easy game.
