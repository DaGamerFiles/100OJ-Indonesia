<0000> There!
<0001> Here!
<0002> Like this!
<0003> Go!
<0004> I'll use this one!
<0005> The power of the card!
<0006> This is my trump card.
<0007> A mysterious power...
<0008> I'll set this here.
<0009> Someone fall for this!
<0010> I'm just putting this card here.
<0011> This could help.
<0012> I'll put on new gear.
<0013> I'll show you what I've got!
<0014> This'll finish you!
<0015> I'm using this!
<0016> Fully charged! GO!
<0017> I can keep going!
<0018> Engines ready to go again!
<0019> Back to the front lines.
<0020> Repairs complete!
<0021> I must work harder.
<0022> I can't move...
<0023> Restart failed...
<0024> It's still no good...
<0025> Take that!
<0026> Go!
<0027> There!
<0028> Here!
<0029> Ouch.
<0030> That hurts!
<0031> Was I hit?
<0032> Where did that come from?
<0033> Metal work complete!
<0034> All fixed!
<0035> I'm all okay now.
<0036> Just in time...
<0037> My plane is out of control!
<0038> I'm getting thrown off course!
<0039> O-o-oh nooooo...
<0040> Where am I going?
<0041> I'm sorry, Red Barrel.
<0042> I'm going down!
<0043> No, I can't last anymore.
<0044> I'm done for!
<0045> Hold it right there!
<0046> Prepare to get beaten!
<0047> Just accept my challenge!
<0048> I'm taking you down!
<0049> Out of my way!
<0050> Ready to intercept.
<0051> If that's how you want it!
<0052> They're in my back?!
<0053> Firing away!
<0054> This is not a threat!
<0055> Take this!
<0056> Fire!
<0057> That hurts!
<0058> Kyaaah!
<0059> Ouch.
<0060> Oww.
<0061> That hurt so much...
<0062> That stings...
<0063> It was a direct hit!
<0064> Owwww!
<0065> Dodge it, Red Barrel!
<0066> Make a circle, Red Barrel!
<0067> It's not gonna hit us!
<0068> I can see it!
<0069> I did it!
<0070> I'm great, arenâ€™t I?
<0071> I beat you!
<0072> One down!
<0073> I didn't make it...
<0074> I lost...
<0075> They got me...
<0076> Too strong...
<0077> It's a bonus!
<0078> I'll help myself!
<0079> The stars are coming to me!
<0080> I found stars!
<0081> Oh no!
<0082> My stars...!
<0083> My stars are running from me!
<0084> Oh no, wait!
<0085> Owwww!
<0086> What's going on here?
<0087> I messed up!
<0088> I fell for a trap?!
<0089> Wow, so big!
<0090> A new enemy?!
<0091> Here comes one big guy!
<0092> Do I have to fight that...?
<0093> I'm earning a ton of stars!
<0094> I'll go gather stars!
<0095> I hope to get a bunch.
<0096> How many am I supposed to gather?
<0097> I'll go shoot them down!
<0098> I'll go take a lot down!
<0099> I'll show them what I can do!
<0100> I'll go beat them all!
<0101> I'll do my best!
<0102> Standing by!
<0103> I'm good to go anytime!
<0104> We're up, Red Barrel.
<0105> Let's roll out, Red Barrel.
<0106> We'll give it all we've got, Red Barrel.
<0107> Take off!
<0108> Red Barrel is ready to fly!
<0109> I did it! I'll be the winner next time too!
<0110> Let's win the next game too, Red Barrel!
<0111> We really did it, Red Barrel!
<0112> A job well done!
<0113> Yay!
<0114> A new upgrade!
<0115> What could this be?
<0116> This is good to have!
<0117> Okay.
<0118> That went pretty well.
<0119> Yes.
<0120> Negative.
<0121> That's horrible.
<0122> Something good just happened!
<0123> Well, um...
<0124> Let's go, Red Barrel.
<0125> Please be a good roll!
<0126> Here I go.
<0127> Hello!
<0128> Hmm...
<0129> Nice!
<0130> Perfect.
<0131> Oh no...
<0132> Mr. Seagull, I'm so sorry!
<0133> Geez, you're equipped with something stupid again.
<0134> You deserved a punishment!
<0135> Geez, you built something like that again!
<0136> I went too far!
<0137> I told you not to get in my way!
<0138> Here I come!
<0139> A flying... pervert?
