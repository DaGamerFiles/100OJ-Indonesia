// ========= Scene: 1-A =========

// (krilap)
<0000> Zzz... I call upon the dark spirits... zzz... this is my ultimate attack... zzz...

// (mimyuuj)
<0001> Hey, you. You're finally awake.

// (krilap)
<0002> Zzz...

// (mimyuuj)
<0003> Mimyuu said, YOU'RE FINALLY AWAKE!

// (krilap)
<0004> Huwha?!

// (mimyuuj)
<0005> Listen up, partner. We ain't meant to be here.

// (krilap)
<0006> What are you doing in my room?

// (mimyuuj)
<0007> We ain't in your room. We're in the big house. The pokey. The government's four star bed and breakfast!

// (krilap)
<0008> Why doth thou speak so oddly? Have the dark spirits possessed your tongue?

// (mimyuuj)
<0009> Prison changes a girl.

// (krilap)
<0010> How long have we been in here...?

// (mimyuuj)
<0011> About four hours. Mimyuu went crazy hour one, got bored of being crazy by hour three. Now Mimyuu's a hard-boiled tough customer.

// (krilap)
<0012> If I go to sleep for another four hours, will you get bored of this character too?

// (mimyuuj)
<0013> You can't go to sleep. We've been framed. Two clowns were running around with our faces and causing a ruckus, so we got caught holding the bag.

// (krilap)
<0014> I'll deal with it in the morning.

// (mimyuuj)
<0015> Don't worry. Mimyuu's got a plan. All we gotta do is bust out of this joint. And to do that, we just need to distract the guard.

// (sorasp)
<0016> Hello. It's breakfast time.

// (krilap)
<0017> B-breakfast? We get food here? For free?

// (sorasp)
<0018> Yes. In prison, you get three meals a day.

// (krilap)
<0019> What a devilish bargain... I may settle here and make this place into my dark stronghold.

// (mimyuuj)
<0020> Ain't this a little burnt, though?

// (sorasp)
<0021> It's Sham's cooking. She's doing her best.

// (krilap)
<0022> Even burnt toast is still a meal... The dark crunchy bits call to my black soul.

// (mimyuuj)
<0023> Hey, guard. What's a girl like you doing working in the clink?

// (sorasp)
<0024> I'm protecting people from bad guys.

// (mimyuuj)
<0025> So why are you wearing a school uniform?

// (sorasp)
<0026> It's only a morning job. I go to school after my shift.

// (mimyuuj)
<0027> It's 10 AM. School already started.

// (sorasp)
<0028> Oh no! I'm late! But if I go, all the prisoners will escape... auuuu...

// (mimyuuj)
<0029> Quick, partner! She's distracted! Bonk her on the head and make a break for it!

// (krilap)
<0030> But... my breakfast! My pillow! I don't want to go!

// (mimyuuj)
<0031> No time! Let's bust on out, partner!

// (sorasp)
<0032> Uuuu... I hope this won't go on my permanent record...

// ========= Scene: 1-B =========

// (mimyuuj)
<0033> We got her! Come on, partner. Let's split.

// (krilap)
<0034> Indeed. You can scout the way, and I, the dark Krilalaris, will go back into the cell and enjoy three square meals a day.

// (mimyuuj)
<0035> You gotta be kidding. You won't last a day in this place.

// (krilap)
<0036> I know much of cages and bars. They cannot contain my fell powers.

// (mimyuuj)
<0037> It ain't that. It's just... there's mandatory hard labour!

// (krilap)
<0038> Ah.

// (mimyuuj)
<0039> And they won't let you browse comics to think up new special attacks!

// (krilap)
<0040> Ahh!

// (mimyuuj)
<0041> And... there's no such thing as a gothic lolita prison jumpsuit!

// (krilap)
<0042> Ahhhh! Quickly! We must flee this place!

// (mimyuuj)
<0043> That's what Mimyuu wanted to hear.

// (sorasp)
<0044> Auuuu...

// (mimyuuj)
<0045> Sorry, kid. Nothing personal. Hate to dump you in a bunch of trouble, but we're outta here.

// (krilap)
<0046> Simply recite this dark spell at the moment of judgement: "I hath suffered an accident in the workplace, and I believe I am entitled to compensation."

// (sorasp)
<0047> Uuuuu... Maybe I can get a sick note.

// ========= Scene: 2-A =========

// (mimyuuj)
<0048> Heh heh! We did it, partner. We're officially on the lam!

// (krilap)
<0049> Lamb... Delicious meat skewers... So hungry... Can't move...

// (mimyuuj)
<0050> You didn't eat breakfast before we made a break for it?

// (krilap)
<0051> You broke us out before I could!

// (mimyuuj)
<0052> Guess we'll duck in here for a snack.

// (mimyuuj)
<0053> Gimme two cups of boiled leaves, a couple bow wows, then take two cackleberries and wreck 'em.

// (chris)
<0054> Will that be all?

// (mimyuuj)
<0055> One glass of moo juice, too.

// (krilap)
<0056> What kind of incantation was that? I don't even know what you ordered...

// (mimyuuj)
<0057> Neither does Mimyuu. But it sounded cool.

// (krilap)
<0058> Coolness is very important. One must always strive to impress the dark forces that surround us.

// (mimyuuj)
<0059> You got that right, partner.

// (krilap)
<0060> I also bestow upon you my thanks for remunerating the establishment in my stead.

// (mimyuuj)
<0061> Huh? Mimyuu ain't paying.

// (krilap)
<0062> I-I have forsaken material possessions as a tenet of my dark faith...

// (mimyuuj)
<0063> We're on the lam, partner. Hardened criminals. And you know what that means.

// (krilap)
<0064> We must rely on it... the dark and forbidden art...

// (mimyuuj)
<0065> That's right - the Dine and Dash.

// (chris)
<0066> Oh, really?

// (krilap)
<0067> Gulp.

// (chris)
<0068> Oh, manager!

// (master)
<0069> ...

// (krilap)
<0070> This day is the worst.

// ========= Scene: 2-B =========

// (mimyuuj)
<0071> Alright, partner! Stuff your pockets with complimentary bread rolls and let's bounce.

// (krilap)
<0072> *nom nom* Thish will be a fine catalysht for my dark powersh...

// (mimyuuj)
<0073> Whoa, your cheeks have ballooned up like a squirrel's. That's talent.

// (chris)
<0074> Oh no... they even took out the manager. This is crazy...

// (mimyuuj)
<0075> Mimyuu's starting to think we maybe deserved that prison sentence.

// (krilap)
<0076> We will bestow upon thee a five star review in recompense.

// (master)
<0077> ...

// (chris)
<0078> In the end, they only took the free bread rolls.

// (master)
<0079> ...

// (chris)
<0080> You really do meet the weirdest people in customer service, huh...

// (master)
<0081> *nod*

// ========= Scene: 3-A =========

// (krilap)
<0082> All I want to do is go back to sleep... Being on the run is so tiring.

// (mescal)
<0083> Hey, you! If you're looking for a comfy way to travel, try Big Magnum Airlines! Around the world in eighty minutes, or your trip is free!

// (mimyuuj)
<0084> Sounds like a good way to shake the fuzz.

// (tequila)
<0085> Aye. But before I can let ye aboard me airship, ye'll have to answer me riddles three.

// (krilap)
<0086> I see... Truly, a devilish bargain.

// (mimyuuj)
<0087> Is he a sphinx or something?

// (tequila)
<0088> First, riddle me this. What has four legs in the -

// (mimyuuj)
<0089> He IS a sphinx!

// (tequila)
<0090> Alright, I'll let ye skip that one. Second riddle: who be the cutest young lass to ever sail the skies?

// (mimyuuj)
<0091> Mescal?

// (tequila)
<0092> Aye, so it be.

// (mimyuuj)
<0093> You looked right at her when you said it.

// (mescal)
<0094> Oh, Daddy.

// (tequila)
<0095> For me last and hardest riddle... What be the sixteen digits on the front of your bank card?

// (krilap)
<0096> That's forbidden knowledge!

// (mimyuuj)
<0097> It was a grift the whole time, huh?

// (tequila)
<0098> O' course! This is piracy in the modern age! But if ye'd prefer, we can be more traditional. Mescal, man the cannons!

// (krilap)
<0099> Please just let me sleep already... Oh, I give up.

// ========= Scene: 3-B =========

// (tequila)
<0100> Grrr... So be it. Ye can ride. I'd best not be hearin' any complaints out of you, though.

// (krilap)
<0101> I have a complaint!

// (mimyuuj)
<0102> Already? We ain't even on the boat yet.

// (krilap)
<0103> Why do you not wear an eyepatch?

// (tequila)
<0104> Because I still have both me eyes, lass.

// (krilap)
<0105> So do I, yet I still clad my evil eye in blackened silk.

// (mescal)
<0106> You know that's no good for your vision, right?

// (krilap)
<0107> You're a pirate, so you have the perfect excuse for eyepatchery! Let us call forth a Federation of Eyepatch Appreciation together.

// (tequila)
<0108> No chance, lass.

// (krilap)
<0109> Hmph. In that case, I will retreat below deck to catch up on my napping.

// (tequila)
<0110> Mescal?

// (mescal)
<0111> Yes, Daddy?

// (tequila)
<0112> Set the engines to full power. A little turbulence will teach her not to take her eyes off a pirate.

// (mescal)
<0113> Right!

// (tequila)
<0114> Me head's aching already... This looks to be a long flight.

// ========= Scene: 4-A =========

// (mimyuuj)
<0115> End of the road, partner.

// (krilap)
<0116> We're right back where we started, though!

// (mimyuuj)
<0117> Obviously. We went around the world, so we came back to the same place. Mimyuu thinks we shook 'em off, though.

// (qp)
<0118> Not so fast!

// (krilap)
<0119> Ahh, the fell incarnation of the beast god... QP.

// (qp)
<0120> Who's QP?! I'm the Great Dog Detective, Sherlock Bones, and I've come to take you in.

// (mimyuuj)
<0121> Mimyuu ain't going back to the big house again. Let's split, partner.

// (krilap)
<0122> I, Krilalaris, will handle this. QP! Hear my cry. I will deliver unto you one cup of convenience store pudding tomorrow, in exchange for safe passage today!

// (qp)
<0123> Sorry, but I can't...

// (krilap)
<0124> What? But... it's pudding. The QP I know would disregard all morality for pudding!

// (qp)
<0125> I told you, I'm Sherlock Bones...

// (krilap)
<0126> She's a kind, gullible soul who always shares her lunch scraps with me if I ask, so much that my stomach rumbles even looking at her.

// (mimyuuj)
<0127> So you're just tricking her into being your meal ticket?

// (krilap)
<0128> You aren't like her at all! You must be a shadow doppelg√§nger sent from the Organization to sow havoc! I will not let you besmirch the name of the beast god!

// (qp)
<0129> Wait, but - the tables turned all of a sudden?! Uwaaa!

// ========= Scene: 4-B =========

// (mimyuuj)
<0130> We actually beat the mutt?

// (krilap)
<0131> Hmph. The true QP's power is much more intense than this imposter's.

// (mimyuuj)
<0132> Really? Kinda felt like the usual, though.

// (krilap)
<0133> The true QP has a powerful mind-control forcefield to prevent people attacking her. If you gaze upon her charming tail fluff, thou art already under her spell...

// (mimyuuj)
<0134> So, she's a cute puppy. So's this one, though.

// (krilap)
<0135> Also, if attacked, the true QP refuses to give lunch scraps the day after. It's a technique for fermenting economic turmoil.

// (mimyuuj)
<0136> If you say so, partner. Let's leave this defective detective in the dust.

// (qp)
<0137> I'm not defective... and don't insult my tail fluff!

// (mimyuuj)
<0138> Detectives are boring anyway. For a real hard-boiled character, private eyes are the way to go.

// (krilap)
<0139> You're only saying that because Yuki has that kind of outfit.

// (mimyuuj)
<0140> The Big Boss is Mimyuu's goal, after all.

// (krilap)
<0141> Your loyalty as a minion of darkness is admirable.

// ========= Scene: 5-A =========

// (mimyuuj)
<0142> Looks like we shook 'em off. Good work, partner.

// (krilap)
<0143> Huff... huff... Hah...

// (mimyuuj)
<0144> That dame with the tail is giving you the side-eye, though.

// (krilap)
<0145> Ufufu... Perhaps she's sensed my dark power.

// (teotoratta)
<0146> Hey, you over there! You've got the scent of a beast.

// (krilap)
<0147> *sniff sniff* I do?

// (mimyuuj)
<0148> Mimyuu didn't want to say anything, but she's right.

// (krilap)
<0149> Ah, no... I've been on the run and I haven't had time to shower... I-I mean, this miasma is simply my dark power escaping through my pores!

// (teotoratta)
<0150> You might know something. I'm sensing some kind of hugely powerful beast over in that direction. As the Beast Witch, I've gotta make it mine!

// (krilap)
<0151> But the circus is over that way... All the animals there are my precious minions already! Has something happened to them?

// (teotoratta)
<0152> Circus? A bunch of dastardly humans lording it over the animals, huh?

// (krilap)
<0153> I won't accept anybody hurting my dark minions! We must depart at once!

// (teotoratta)
<0154> Hey, hey! You're gonna try and cut ahead of me to make that beast your minion, even though I was the one who told you about it? Kinda rude, don't you think?

// (mimyuuj)
<0155> She's got you there, Stinky.

// (krilap)
<0156> S-silence! If you stand in my way, I will enact a carnival of blood!

// (teotoratta)
<0157> Fu-fu-fu. So it's survival of the fittest, huh? Let me show you how a real beast dances! Gaaao!

// ========= Scene: 5-B =========

// (teotoratta)
<0158> Ugh... I never thought I'd lose to another beast master. My pride as a witch just took serious damage.

// (mimyuuj)
<0159> My partner's kind of a dork, but she's got some real skill.

// (krilap)
<0160> Ufufu. You still fail to understand my dark aesthetic... Anyway. Beast Witch, I will bestow this upon you.

// (teotoratta)
<0161> Huh? I-Is this pet food?

// (krilap)
<0162> It is one of the treats with which I tempt the mighty lions of our circus.

// (teotoratta)
<0163> I don't know how to feel about this... It does smell good, though.

// (krilap)
<0164> Indeed. I get the best lion treats, for they can function as rations of last resort on long winter days...

// (teotoratta)
<0165> That's just depressing.

// (krilap)
<0166> Regardless, it is my parting gift to thee. Farewell!

// (teotoratta)
<0167> ... *crunch*

// (teotoratta)
<0168> Huh. Not bad.

// ========= Scene: 6-A =========

// (mimyuuj)
<0169> This is it, partner. The big time.

// (krilap)
<0170> You mean the big top.

// (mimyuuj)
<0171> That too.

// (unknown)
<0172> Fuhuhu... Finally, you've arrived... My other self!

// (krilap)
<0173> You!

// (krila)
<0174> It is I, the dark Krilalaris!

// (mimyuu&tomato)
<0175> Plus the up and coming stars of Waruda!

// (krila)
<0176> I knew you would come here, my dark nemesis. But you are too late. I have enacted the blood ritual! Leo has ascended!

// (No Speaker)
<0177> *roaaaaaar*

// (krila)
<0178> He is now Dark Calamity Leo, the Apocalypse Liger!

// (mimyuuj)
<0179> Mimyuu ain't no animal doctor, but wasn't he a lion before?

// (krilap)
<0180> Ligers are cooler.

// (krila)
<0181> Silence! Now, our fated duel is at hand. We must battle for control of the ultimate Leo!

// (mimyuu&tomato)
<0182> Hey you, other Mimyuu! Aren't you missing somebody? Sure you can challenge us solo like that?

// (mimyuuj)
<0183> Heh. Joke's on you. Mimyuu may not have her own Boss, but her partner's been right beside her the whole time.

// (krilap)
<0184> My dark other self... you are destined to fall. Because I, the dark-ER Krilalaris, possess something you do not!

// (krila)
<0185> Oh?

// (krilap)
<0186> At long last, I have stolen it - the power of friendship!

// (mimyuuj)
<0187> You tell them, partner!

// (krilap)
<0188> Actually, I was talking about my friendship with Leo.

// (mimyuuj)
<0189> Guh...

// (krila)
<0190> Enough! I will defeat myself for control of the ultimate darkness! Let the mad beasts dance.

// ========= Scene: 6-B =========

// (mimyuuj)
<0191> Well, we beat those guys... But that lion's still raising the roof.

// (krilap)
<0192> His right paw... I can feel the dark power emanating from it!

// (mimyuuj)
<0193> Whoa, he's coming this way! Calm him down, would ya?!

// (krilap)
<0194> The unsealed king of beasts approaches... N-N-Now is the time to draw forth my hidden power!

// (mimyuuj)
<0195> I'll watch your back, partner. From over here.

// (krilap)
<0196> W-w-wait, come back! The dark power is having an off day today -

// (krilap)
<0197> Ah... I've been consumed by darkness...

// (krilap)
<0198> This is... Calamity Leo's fur...? So warm... and comfy... finally... my eternal... rest... zzzzzzz...

// (mimyuu)
<0199> Oi, Krila! Get up already!

// (krilap)
<0200> Uwaah! I was travelling the realm of dreams the whole time?

// (yukid)
<0201> Better get up soon. Those lions need feeding, you know? Better not underestimate the wrath of a big cat.

// (krilap)
<0202> I feel like I didn't sleep at all...

// (yukid)
<0203> Well, get up and get ready to move out. We've got big plans today. If we pull this off, there's some extra lunch in it for you.

// (krilap)
<0204> A nice meal... I'll use all my power to obtain it!

// (mimyuu)
<0205> Looks like you and Mimyuu are partnering up today. Let's get out there and cause some trouble.

// (krilap)
<0206> It seems our destinies are tied together... Partner.
