<0000> Lemme do this!
<0001> There!
<0002> Yah!
<0003> Toryah!
<0004> I'll play a card!
<0005> Now's the time for this!
<0006> How's this! I'll break through!
<0007> Looks like I have to use this.
<0008> Kufufu, I sure love stuff like this.
<0009> I'm laying a trap here.
<0010> Who's going to fall for this, I wonderâ™ª
<0011> Waruda's speciality: Brutal traps!
<0012> Battle card!
<0013> I think I have to use this.
<0014> Tomato will turn invincible with this!
<0015> This is my strategy!
<0016> Waruda machine, blast off!
<0017> How dare you bully Mimyuu!
<0018> Well done, Mimyuu. I'll take it from here.
<0019> Mimyuu, here's a reward snack for your efforts.
<0020> Mimyuu's enemy is my enemy!
<0021> Ugh...
<0022> Dammit...
<0023> Mimyuu...
<0024> I messed up coming back...!?
<0025> Waruda attack!
<0026> I'll take you down!
<0027> Kufufu!
<0028> Tooryaaah!
<0029> That hurts!
<0030> The heck you doing!?
<0031> Kuu!
<0032> Uwah!
<0033> That helps a bunch!
<0034> That was a good break!
<0035> Kufuu, I've been saved!
<0036> I feel so much better now!
<0037> A warp!
<0038> Guwaah, I'm getting kidnapped!
<0039> Where am I going to!?
<0040> This feels funny in my stomach!
<0041> D-damn it...
<0042> G-glory to Waruda...
<0043> Even if I go down, Mimyuu will...
<0044> Mimyuu, you got this... *collapse*
<0045> It's battle time!
<0046> Check out my awesome technology!
<0047> Fufufu! I'll beat you the heck up!
<0048> If you wish to apologize, now's the chance!
<0049> Very well, challenge accepted!
<0050> Kufufu, bring it on!
<0051> An enemy!?
<0052> Talk about reckless!
<0053> Toryah!
<0054> Take this!
<0055> You bastard!
<0056> Bang!
<0057> Ouch!
<0058> Hey, cut it out!
<0059> What the heck are you doing!?
<0060> Gyan!
<0061> How dare you! I'm gonna cry!
<0062> What the heck do you think you're doing!?
<0063> That hurts so muuuch!
<0064> Bieee!
<0065> Did you even aim at me?
<0066> You missed!
<0067> You suck!
<0068> Idiot!
<0069> Alright, I did it!
<0070> Yes, I won!
<0071> We did it, Mimyuu.
<0072> Alright, next!
<0073> Woe is me...
<0074> How could someone like that beat me?
<0075> God damn it!
<0076> I'm so mad at myself!
<0077> These stars are mine!
<0078> I'll take these!
<0079> I love having these!
<0080> I'll buy Mimyuu some snacks with these.
<0081> Nuoo! My stars!
<0082> Wait! Don't be gone!
<0083> Come on, you can't disappear like that!
<0084> My stars are leaving me...
<0085> Guwah, it's a trap!
<0086> What a sneaky trap!
<0087> Gee! Why would anyone put this down here!?
<0088> I don't usually fall for stuff like this...
<0089> There's something terrifying nearby now.
<0090> What is that? Huge and scary.
<0091> Mimyuu, you stay away from whatever that is, okay...
<0092> That looks like so much trouble... Ugh.
<0093> Gathering stars? I got this!
<0094> All the stars in the world will be Waruda's!
<0095> Kufufu, I'll get tons of stars and buy tons of candies!
<0096> Want to go for stars with me, Mimyuu? Let's work hard together, then!
<0097> You're not a Waruda member if you refuse to fight!
<0098> Mimyuu and I will go wreck everything! 
<0099> Keep your eyes peeled for my Waruda machine!
<0100> I'll crush them all!
<0101> I'm Tomato! Mimyuu's here, too!
<0102> We're Waruda!
<0103> Mimyuu, let's go play!
<0104> We're ready to bring order to chaos!
<0105> Mimyuu, let's do this!
<0106> Let's go, Mimyuu! We'll make the world know how great Waruda is!
<0107> We're going to play our butts off, Mimyuu!
<0108> Game on!
<0109> We won!
<0110> Mimyuu, we'll throw a candy party to celebrate!
<0111> This is the power of Waruda! Fufufu!
<0112> Mimyuu, we're the strongest duo ever!
<0113> Oh, looks like that'll come in handy.
<0114> Fufufu, what prank can we play with that, I wonder.
<0115> Nice, it's a new item!
<0116> We should go try this new thing now!
<0117> Okay.
<0118> Neato.
<0119> Alright.
<0120> Nope.
<0121> Hmm.
<0122> You got lucky.
<0123> Huh?
<0124> Here we go.
<0125> Roll the dice!
<0126> Go!
<0127> Yo!
<0128> Mhm...
<0129> Great.
<0130> Awesome!
<0131> What the heck!
<0132> I'll make someone else's power mine!
<0133> Wow! I don't know whose this is, but I'll play it anyway!
<0134> No idea what this card does, but I'm desperate!
<0135> I can even handle my opponent's power!
<0136> Mimyuu, I'm here to play with you.
<0137> What, Mimyuu? I'm busy now.
<0138> I'm proud of you, Mimyuu. You're getting stronger and stronger.
<0139> Was it fun, Mimyuu?
<0140> Mimyuu's gizmo just went off!
<0141> You underestimated Mimyuu for being short, didn't you?
<0142> Heh, I'm glad you're on my side... Mimyuu.
<0143> Do it now, Mimyuu!
<0144> Boss, let's play together!
<0145> Boss...!? Are you going to test us?
<0146> We've finally surpassed Boss...
<0147> Boss is strong...
<0148> I can tell he's a bad guy!
<0149> Whoa, he looks scary!
<0150> He looked scary, but it was just the surface.
<0151> So, he's the true bad guy...
<0152> I really feel sorry for those penguins!
<0153> You... You're the one who's always bullying the penguins!
<0154> Now you've learned your lesson. No more bullying!
<0155> Damn it... I'm sorry, penguins...
