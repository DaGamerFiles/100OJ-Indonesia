<0000> "Pigformation"\nA form you end up taking when you no longer find pleasure in living.\nIn 2019, the world experiences the largest wave of pigformation in history!
<0001> No matter where I look... everyone's turning into a pig.
<0002> ...
<0003> Sora, you have to help me! Or else the world is going to be in a right down mess.
<0004> Saving the world is what humans are supposed to do. I'm a pig so I don't care.
<0005> Oh no... She's completely pigformed now.
<0006> ...
<0007> Oh, QP. Please be yourself again. If the world's filled with pigs, you won't be able to eat pudding ever again!
<0008> Who cares about that stupid food you can make by just mixing up milk, eggs, and sugar?
<0009> ...
<0010> Ah, Aru, wait up!
<0011> What do you need from me? You're in luck, though. I have plenty of time to spare.
<0012> Don't tell me even you're one of them...
<0013> ...
<0014> Take a look at this.
<0015> ...What is it?
<0016> A list of present requests from children this year.
<0017> ...
<0018> There's no way Santa could make NiOtendo SwOtches.
<0019> Those days are gone when Santa made presents herself and delivered them. I'm out of business now. Will you just leave me alone?
<0020> ......
<0021> Oh boy, speaking to them doesn't help a bit.
<0022> I hate to be harsh on them, but I need to force them back to the way they were.
<0023> Let's go, Red Barrel!
<0024> Vroooom!
<0025> Marc thus makes up her mind to save the world from the pigformation all by herself.\nShe does not yet know what destiny awaits her...
<0026> The bodies pile up high.
<0027> Ugh, look what I have done. But the pigformation ought to cease now.
<0028> ...Uu.
<0029> She's still a pig... Hear me out, Sora. If this planet gets ruined, even pigs can't live here.
<0030> ...Right!
<0031> ...Oooooooow.
<0032> Look, QP. Imagine putting pudding's ingredients all together in your mouth. Do you think they would taste anything like pudding? They only become pudding when prepared correctly.
<0033> ...Right!
<0034> ...Ugh.
<0035> Aru, listen to me. If you can't make presents yourself, you can get them from a toy store. The store can make a profit, and you can deliver the children what they want. It's win-win.
<0036> ...Right! ...Wait, what?
<0037> All right, great work out there, Red Ba-... Where did you get that scratch on your wing? And, is that a pig tail you have back there...?
<0038> ...What's going on, Marc?
<0039> If I pay for the repairs, I'll get in the red this month... Also, gas is very expensive right now...
<0040> ...Marc?
<0041> I wanna be a pig... I wanna be a pig...
<0042> She's gone.
<0043> Let's follow her. We can't leave her alone.
<0044> You're right. It's our turn to help her out!
<0045> The global pigformation still continues.
<0046> It's not so bad to turn into a pig and fly around when you feel a little bit tired of everyday life.
<0047> The fantasy won't last long and you'll eventually have to fold your wings and go back to living as a human again.
<0048> But until then, have a nice, crimson dream.
<0049> The End.
