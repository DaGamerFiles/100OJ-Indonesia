<0000> Alright, Mimyuu, say the words out loud!
<0001> Aye aye, boss! Trick or...
<0002> Treat!!!
<0003> There you go, Mimyuu! I bet that with your cute looks and eccentric voice you are going to get us all the candies in town!
<0004> Hooray! Candy! Mimyuu wants to swim around in a sea of candy with her mouth full of candy!
<0005> Hahaha! Your dream will come true if we pull off this plan!
<0006> The sea of candy will be real? Woo-hoo! A flood of drool is coming the heck out of Mimyuu's mouth!!!
<0007> ...Things are kind of crazy around here.
<0008> Because it's Halloween today. Kids like them must be very excited.
<0009> That so?
<0010> Oh, there are people walking down the street. Alright then...
<0011> Mimyuu, they're our first target! It's time to put our plan into action!
<0012> Roger that.
<0013> *dash*
<0014> Trick or treat!!!
<0015> Mhmm?
<0016> Fufufu. Now, what are we going to do, Tsih?
<0017> Kiddo, you saying you'll play a trick on me?
<0018> That's right! Give Mimyuu some candy, or else today will be the last day of your life!
<0019> Whoa, that freaks me out. Okay then, you can have this!
<0020> Hooray! Candy!
<0021> Wait, Tsih! That's...!
<0022> *bite*
<0023> ......
<0024> Mi...
<0025> Migyaaaaaaah!!!
<0026> Mi-Mimyuu! What's wrong...?!
<0027> Ababababa, Mimyuu's mouth feels minty fresh!!! Super duper minty!!!
<0028> Damn it. Mimyuu, you've got to hang in there!
<0029> *chuckle*
<0030> You bastard! What the heck did you make Mimyuu eat!
<0031> Mhm? It's just a stick of chewing gum that's a super stimulant!
<0032> It's messing up Mimyuu's mouth so hard!
<0033> Mimyuu, just spit it out! Now!
<0034> It's still got the taste, though...
<0035> Don't be stupid!
<0036> Kukuku, the only ones who are allowed to play tricks are the ones who are prepared to be played tricks on. Take that to heart, kiddos.
<0037> Oh, boy...
<0038> You know what makes me jealous? The way those kids get that stoked about nothing but tiny, little candies.
<0039> I like candy, but, right now, I'm more in the mood for... salty snacks...
<0040> ......
<0041> Everything okay, Tsih?
<0042> ...Nyufufu, I have a good idea.
<0043> Alte, we're going to enjoy Halloween in an adult way.
<0044> In an adult way? What do you mean by that?
<0045> We should get a couple more people. Guess I'll hit them up.
<0046> That said, I called y'all over.
<0047> Huh... I thought this was something more urgent.
<0048> Fufufu, I'd be happy to be part of this. Sounds like it'll be fun.
<0049> Tsih, you always do stuff without thinking.
<0050> Huh? You don't want to do this, Alte?
<0051> I uh... Well, I find this enjoyable, too.
<0052> No problemo, then!
<0053> Now, we start Operation Halloween for Grown-ups!!!
<0054> Yeaaah~
<0055> *sigh* If I am going to do this, I'll do an excellent job of it.
<0056> Sure, let's make the most of it.
<0057> Everyone, we'll all work the hardest to get the best drinks ever!
<0058> Y'all ready?
<0059> Cheers.
<0060> *gulp gulp gulp gulp* Ahh.
<0061> Phew... sure is good...
<0062> Man, why's it that after-work drinks always taste so good?
<0063> Agreed... It's like it's cleansing both mind and body. I like this.
<0064> Ladies, it's too early to be sated. Our Halloween has only just begun.
<0065> Don't forget we have these. Ta-da!
<0066> The snacks for drinks we gathered!
<0067> Whoa, that's plenty.
<0068> Now that's what I've been looking forward to.
<0069> Do we have any dried squid? I like its legs.
<0070> Now, it's time to blow off some steam. Let's treat ourselves with all these good drinks and snacks.
<0071> Yeaaah~
<0072> *munch munch* Is it just me, or does Tsih look like she lives a life free from stress?
<0073> *gulp* Ahh. Do I look that way? Oh well, fine by me.
<0074> Tsih, you're not talking like a little kid anymore.
<0075> Fufufu, I've decided I don't have to do that now.
<0076> Oh, so, you're usually a wolf in sheep's clothing?
<0077> I'm usually better off that way because of how I look. I mean, I can take my enemies' guards down more easily when I talk like that.
<0078> But, right now, I only have my drinking buddies here, so I feel like being my true self...
<0079> Not bad, is it?
<0080> Yeah, I guess.
<0081> I prefer you that way, because it makes our drinking more comfortable.
<0082> Look at us: Four beautiful, sexy women relaxing over drinks... What a picturesque setting.
<0083> Yeah, that's absolutely true. Give me another glass of this.
<0084> I guess I might just as well let the beautiful, sexy part slide. Can I also get a refill?
<0085> *munch munch* The squid's good. I'd like another drink, too.
<0086> We're all drinking so fast tonight. Can't help it, though, because of the amount of snacks we have here.
<0087> Aaaah. We did enough to deserve this, you know.
<0088> Yeah. It was surprisingly fun.
<0089> The fun is still on, right?
<0090> Yeah, it is.
<0091> We're still having fun. Plenty of it.
<0092> Best day ever. Thanks so much for having us, Tsih.
<0093> Fufufu, sure, anytime.
<0094> But... the real fun hasn't even started yet, you know?
<0095> Right. The night is still young.
<0096> Also, we obviously won't run out of the snacks anytime soon.
<0097> Right on. Tonight, we won't have to slow down our drinking.
<0098> So, everyone...
<0099> Let's drink the night away~
