<0076> Can't believe I lost...
<0077> Stars!
<0078> The stars are shining!
<0079> Wow, they're pretty!
<0080> A gift of stars!
<0081> Wawawah, my stars!
<0082> Wah, I dropped some stars!
<0083> Stars, wait for me!
<0084> Auu... The stars are gone...
<0085> A trap!?
<0086> Uaah, it's a trap!
<0087> Howah!
<0088> Oh shoot!
<0089> Fue!? Someone came out of nowhere!?
<0090> Awawah...
<0091> I'll beat whoever is standing in my way!
<0092> This guy looks pretty strong...
<0093> I choose to gather stars!
<0094> I like star-gathering.
<0095> I guess I'll get myself a bunch of stars.
<0096> Stars it is!
<0097> I know I'm not a good fighter, but still...
<0098> I'll give no mercy to anyone who tries to stop me!
<0099> I'll fight with the support of my Santa powers!
<0100> Bad kids must be punished!

<0102> You wanna help me give kids presents?
<0103> Okay, it's time for work!
<0104> Kids around the world, I'm on my way!
<0105> And thus it begins!
<0106> Alright, I'll do my best!

<0135> Can't wait to see what will happen!
<0136> Here's a present for you!
<0137> Oh, Ms. Q... Whoops, I don't need to call her that now.
<0138> Welcome to the Rbit Room... Whoops, it just slipped out of my mouth.
<0139> I'm sorry, bunnies...
<0140> Uu, I'm glad that someone this strong is a regular at my shop...
<0141> You, I know you're a bad person!
<0142> Boy, that's one dangerous woman.
<0143> No presents for bad people!
<0144> It's just my outfit that's red...
<0145> Wow, such a little kid.
<0146> What? You two are bad kids?
<0147> Be good girls and I'll give you two presents.
<0148> Uu, I knew you two were bad kids...
<0149> Are you a good girl?
<0150> Wawah, a little girl!
