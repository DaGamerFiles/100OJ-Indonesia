<0000> A couple Christmases ago, in two different worlds, two different confrontations took place.
<0001> The fights both happened between Santa Claus and a toy store clerk trying to impede her gift deliveries.
<0002> The two incidents were almost alike in every way.
<0003> The only difference was that the culprits weren't the same.
<0004> Crossed Christmases: Prologue
<0005> Christmas is just around the corner.\nWhen it comes to my business, it's the best time of year.
<0006> Phew...
<0007> But, before that, there's something I've got to do.
<0008> I owe someone big time, and I have to return the favor.
<0009> *Ring ring*
<0010> Mhm?\nOh, speak of the devil.
<0011> Yeah.
<0012> Mr. Arthur, I need your help with some Christmas presents for this year!
<0013> Heh, talk about good timing.\nI was just about to call you.
<0014> You did a lot for me before, so this time I'll do what I can for you.
<0015> Thank you so much, Mr. Arthur!
<0016> So, the thing is, there are a couple of present requests that I can't deal with by myself...
<0017> Go on.
<0018> Have you heard of the "Beat Down! Tomomo Punching Bag"?
<0019> What!? The Tomomo Punching Bag!?
<0020> It has an exquisitely annoying design to it, and offers the best punching experience ever...
<0021> When punched, it plays a really satisfying groan. It's a best-selling stress relief product both children and adults would kill for.
<0022> I heard the stuff's so popular that the demand is way greater than the supply.
<0023> That's right. That makes it difficult for me to acquire them.
<0024> They sure are very hard to come by, but...
<0025> I got this. I'll get you as many of them as you need.
<0026> Thank you, Mr. Arthur!
<0027> You're...
<0028> ...!
<0029> ...What's your deal?\nOut of my way.
<0030> Y-you get out!
<0031> I'm on a job, and I'm taking these Tomomo Punching Bags.
<0032> Wait! Those are Nico's!
<0033> Nico...!?
<0034> Santa asked Nico to get some of those for her, so you have to let Nico finish her job.
<0035> Santa... asked you?
<0036> You're working for her, too?
<0037> Huh?
<0038> What are the odds?\nI'm doing this for Santa, too.
<0039> Really?
<0040> Yeah. She begged me to help her get the toy industry's hot ticket.
<0041> *Ring ring*
<0042> Good timing. It's her.
<0043> Mr. Arthur!
<0044> Hey.\nI got my hands on the Tomomo Punching Bags you requested.
<0045> I knew you'd manage! Thanks a lot!
<0046> ...And there's this other thing I need you to get for me...
<0047> Just tell me.
<0048> Have your heard of "16x Big Huggy Pillow"?
<0049> What... 16x Big Huggy Pillow!?
<0050> Did you say 16x Big Huggy Pillow!?\nThey say those are so nice to hug, you can relax 16 times more than usual and get an awesome sleep...
<0051> Yeah, and that makes them crazy popular. Online pre-orders always run out in a minute. They sure are extremely hard to come by.
<0052> Um... Would you mind?
<0053> Heh, consider it done.
<0054> ...Are you sure?
<0055> If Santa's asking for it, it means there are children that want it.
<0056> Making children happy is my job.
<0057> Okay...
<0058> Well then, Nico thinks she'll work with you, too!
<0059> Huh?
<0060> Nico and you are both working for Santa, so it'll be faster if we work together, right?
<0061> This is no easy job, though.
<0062> That's why we should work together.\nThe more people, the faster we can get the job done.
<0063> Okay...\nGot it, we'll do this together.
<0064> All right!
<0065> We somehow managed to get ourselves the 16x Big Huggy Pillows.
<0066> Yeah, Nico's relieved now.
<0067> *Ring ring*
<0068> Seems like we shouldn't be chilling yet.
<0069> Au... Nico wonders what Santa needs this time.
<0070> Wh-what, are you sure...!?
<0071> Wh-what, what!?\nWhat is it this time!?
<0072> "Accelerator"...
<0073> Accelerator!?\nThat popular toy that makes you feel able to run faster for some reason or another when you put it on your back!?
<0074> Lots of children want those for their sports day. Well, it's out of season right now, so it should be easier to find than some of the items...
<0075> Uh, no, we're in trouble!
<0076> What now?
<0077> The Accelerator...\nThey're out of production.
<0078> How can that be!?\nThey were extremely popular...
<0079> Apparently there were customer complaints that the toy forced the heat gauge up...
<0080> Running fast produces heat.\nIt's only natural... Idiots.
<0081> Uuu, Nico kind of wanted one of those, too.
<0082> ...Anyway, there's only one way to find the stuff: look everywhere.
<0083> Haah, haah...
<0084> Here.
<0085> Yay, it's iced chocolate!
<0086> You prefer cold drinks even in cold months, don't you?
<0087> Yes. Nico's not a fan of hot drinks.\n...Hold on, how did you know that?
<0088> I wonder. I just thought so.
<0089> Okay... Thanks anyway!
<0090> We'll move on to the next target when you finish that drink and take some rest.
<0091> What's next?
<0092> It's a plushie from the "Beasts Dancing in the Dark" series.
<0093> If Nico remembers right, they're all handmade and only a few are ever on the market...
<0094> Yeah...\nWhy do children want all these things that require so much effort to obtain?
<0095> Ahaha, of course they do, because they're children.
<0096> You'd know, wouldn't you?
<0097> Uuu...
<0098> So, what is it you want for Christmas?\nOne of those Accelerators, you say?
<0099> Nico doesn't want anything.
<0100> ...You don't?
<0101> No.
<0102> That's the last thing parents would want to hear from their child at this time of year.
<0103> Ehehe, Nico did something very bad, and it had to do with Christmas presents.
<0104> What? Did you have a fight with Santa or something?
<0105> What, how did you know?
<0106> I just thought so.
<0107> ...You're like a psychic.
<0108> It's because I'm a grown-up.
<0109> Grown-ups are incredible.
<0110> Anyway, after that happened, Nico's wanted to be the one to give presents.
<0111> But if Nico had to say, what she wants is to see the happy smiles of all the children around the world.
<0112> All right, we should get moving.
<0113> Hey, Nico just said something really cool!!
<0114> Boy, Nico thinks she'll get a good night's sleep tonight.
<0115> If you're tired, you can go home now.
<0116> Nico's tired, but she's only going to to go home after we get this job done.
<0117> Okay. Good news is, once we get our hands on the next thing, we can call it a day.\nHang in there a little longer.
<0118> Yup!
<0119> The bad news is, this last thing could be the hardest.
<0120> Oh, Nico got a message from Santa on her phone, too.\nLet's see...
<0121> Wait... Is this for real...?
<0122> A flying castle.
<0123> A castle as a Christmas present...\nHow can anyone be that greedy!
<0124> Ku-ku-ku, well, I approve of that request.
<0125> Because you think it's something a child would want?
<0126> Yeah.
<0127> That's still way too crazy a request, though.\nHow in the world are we supposed to get a castle?
<0128> We've worked everything out so far.\nWe should be able to figure this one out too.
<0129> You think so?
<0130> Don't you?
<0131> Nico thinks it's possible if she works with you.
<0132> All right then, let's go finish our last and biggest job.
<0133> Yeah! Let's give it our best shot!
<0134> We did it! We're all done!
<0135> Yeah, great job.
<0136> What are we gonna do now?\nYou wanna go grab some food?
<0137> Nico's starving.\n...But she's sure Mama's got dinner ready at home.
<0138> Yeah, I think you're right.
<0139> How about you?
<0140> I told my wife I'd be home late tonight.\nI don't know what to do now.
<0141> So, you're married.
<0142> Yeah, and I have a daughter, too.
<0143> Does she happen to look like Nico?
<0144> She looks enough like you that I almost mistook you for her.
<0145> Nico's papa looks like you, too.\nAre these just coincidences?
<0146> You even have the same name as my daughter.\nIf all of these are pure coincidences, I'll be amazed... But who knows...
<0147> Mr. Arthur! I'm so sorry I asked a lot of big favors of you!
<0148> Here comes Santa.
<0149> Nico! Thank you so much! You've really helped me out!
<0150> Santa's here.
<0151> What...!? A-are you me!?
<0152> There are two of me!?
<0153> Um... What do you think is going on here?
<0154> It's just my guess, but we're probably not from the same world, you and I.
<0155> In my world, I got Santa in trouble.
<0156> And Nico did so in hers.
<0157> And I figure you're the daughter of the Arthur in your world.
<0158> That makes sense...\nHow did things turn out like this?
<0159> Beats me. There's one big problem, though.
<0160> What's that?
<0161> Which one of the Santas will take the presents we gathered?
<0162> Ah.
<0163> Naturally, I'll side with the Santa from my world.
<0164> Nico will...
<0165> You did bad things to the Santa from your world, didn't you?
<0166> Yes.
<0167> Then you know what to do.\nYou may be my daughter...\nNo, since you're my daughter, I won't go easy.
<0168> Yeah, Nico agrees.
<0169> Huh?\nWhat's happening here, Mr. Arthur?
<0170> Calm down, Nico!\nI want to know what's going on.
<0171> You can't beat me, Papa!
<0172> Bring it, Nico.
<0173> Well done.\nThe presents are all yours now.
<0174> What are you gonna do about the presents for your world?
<0175> Easy, I'll just go gather them all again.
<0176> Uuu, that's not easy at all.
<0177> But, you know, that's the only choice left.
<0178> Searching for all those things all over again...?\nEek!
<0179> Uuu...
<0180> Everything okay with you?
<0181> Uuu! Nico's exhausted!\nAnd her dinner's getting cold by the minute!
<0182> But.
<0183> Nico will help you!
<0184> What?
<0185> You don't have to force yourself.
<0186> Nico said she'll help you!
<0187> Go home now or you'll get in trouble.
<0188> Uu... Will Papa yell at me?
<0189> You bet.\nAnd he'll also cut your allowance in half for the next few months.
<0190> Uuu! But, but!
<0191> Nico will help you!\nBecause it's just wrong to get your Santa in trouble so Nico can return the favor to her Santa!
<0192> Also, Nico wants all the children to be happy, no matter what world they live in!
<0193> Papa, is Nico wrong?
<0194> ...
<0195> ...
<0196> *Sigh*
<0197> You've grown up, Nico.
<0198> Nico knows, right?
<0199> Let's hurry up and get this done so you can get home ASAP.
<0200> Yeah!
<0201> I'll work my hardest to help my other self, too!
<0202> Thanks, me!\nAnd thanks, Nico!
<0203> All right, it's time for present hunting part 2!\nLet's do this, everyone!
<0204> Yeah!
<0205> Yeah.
