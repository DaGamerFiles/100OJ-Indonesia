<0000> Phew, thanks a lot for your hard work, everyone!
<0001> I can't thank you enough!\nThis year's Christmas will be saved because of all of you!
<0002> Not so fast. You guys still have to deliver the presents.\nI wouldn't relax just yet.
<0003> Well, we're pros, you know.
<0004> That's right. If Rein and I work together, the delivery will be a piece of cake!
<0005> Wow, Rein must be so competent.
<0006> We are competent, too!
<0007> Yeah, right.\nYou two are great, too.
<0008> By the way, aside from all the other presents...\nWhere will this huge one go?
<0009> Ah, that flying castle.\nThe kid that asked for it has to be really daring.
<0010> Ah, that castle.\nBasically, every present should be worth about the same.
<0011> But the castle was requested by a thousand children together.\nThey all wished for it as one present.
<0012> So this one single castle will make a thousand wishes come true at once, huh.
<0013> They want to make it into a place where all the children in town can have a Christmas party.
<0014> Wow! Sounds so nice!\nNico's jealous. It'll be a lot of fun!
<0015> Partying with many people at a sparkling castle!\nJust imagining that makes me excited!
<0016> I know, right? It's gonna be so fun!\nI just couldn't resist the urge to make that wish come true!
<0017> Having a Christmas party in that castle...?
<0018> Mr. Arthur, is there a problem?
<0019> ...Santa, will that work out?
<0020> Well, a thousand wishes are still not enough for a castle this size, but...
<0021> That's not what I meant.\nIf they want to use the castle as a party place, it should be delivered a day ahead of the other presents...?
<0022> Otherwise, they won't be able to throw the party on Christmas day.
<0023> Oh...?
<0024> That's true...!
<0025> But just a day ahead is nothing, is it...?
<0026> Uuu...\nActually, there's a catch.
<0027> Our powers get the strongest during the night of Christmas.
<0028> And that's how we can deliver presents all around the world...\nBut except for that particular night...
<0029> We can't do anything special, save for flying in the sky.
<0030> Whaaat!?
<0031> One normal present wouldn't be a problem, but this castle...\nAlso, we're going to have to travel very far to deliver it.
<0032> And we need to decorate it before the delivery.
<0033> What kind of decoration?
<0034> Those thousand children...\nThey want it snow-covered.
<0035> Wow, that'll make it look more like a Christmas party place.\nNico wants to see it, too!
<0036> But there's another problem: it hardly snows around here, so we're going to have to gather the snow from other places and put it on the castle.
<0037> Oh no.
<0038> The more we think about this situation we're in, the more desperate it seems.\nWhat should we do...?
<0039> The castle is something a thousand kids wished for.\nThere's no choice but to get this done.
<0040> But...
<0041> This is too much work for just the two of us,\nand *mumble*mumble*...
<0042> Of course, I'll help.
<0043> Nico will, too!
<0044> Y-you two...
<0045> But we can't trouble you two even more.
<0046> We gave you guys trouble first.
<0047> He's right.\nAnd...
<0048> Gathering snow and making a snow-covered castle sounds like so much fun!\nNico will show her good taste and decorate the castle super cute!
<0049> How very nice of you two...
<0050> I'm tearing up...
<0051> No time to be crying.\nChristmas is almost here.
<0052> Right!\nAll right, let's do this!
<0053> Yeah, let's make the castle gorgeous and beautiful!
<0054> Yeah!
<0055> Everyone, once again.
<0056> Great work! Cheers!
<0057> Cheers!\nBoy, Nico really is exhausted.
<0058> After setting up that castle, you two even helped us deliver the other presents.
<0059> We don't know how to thank you...
<0060> We're sorry this is the best we can do as a token of our gratitude...
<0061> No problem. It's more than enough.
<0062> Wow, we have a lot of bread and rice balls and stuff.
<0063> Go ahead and get whatever you like, Nico!
<0064> Yeah! Thanks, Santa.
<0065> Don't eat too much, though.
<0066> Why not!? Nico worked enough to deserve it.
<0067> You won't be able to enjoy what's coming next.
<0068> Huh? What are you talking about?
<0069> Fufufu, I didn't forget about it, either.\nToday is... I mean, the date has already changed.
<0070> Happy birthday, Nico!
<0071> Huh...?
<0072> This is for you from us Santas.
<0073> Wow... It's a big cake.
<0074> And this is from me.
<0075> A present...!
<0076> That's what my daughter wanted.\nYou'll like it, too. Just my guess, though.
<0077> Uu... Uu...
<0078> *cry*!
<0079> Oh dear.
<0080> There, there.
<0081> Papa... and Santa, thank you.
<0082> But, Nico.
<0083> I think it's a little too early for you to say thank you.
<0084> Fue...? Is there more to come...?
<0085> Fufufu.\nIt's the one you want to celebrate your birthday the most.
<0086> Is that...
<0087> Nico!
<0088> !!!
<0089> Waah!
<0090> Ahaha, good for you, huh Nico?
<0091> *Lights a cigarette*
<0092> Phew...
<0093> I suppose it's time to go home.
<0094> After all, I still have my own daughter's birthday to celebrate.
<0095> ...Happy birthday, Nico.
