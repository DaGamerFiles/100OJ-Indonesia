<0000> "Hey, <player>! It's Christmas!"
<0001> "Children all over the world are excitedly waiting for their presents."
<0002> "It's been a big hurdle getting everything ready in time, but seeing the warm smiles on the children's faces makes it all worth it."
<0003> "You'll get a present too, of course! Here, pick any you like."
<0004> "There you go! How do you like it?"
<0005> "Wait... It's empty!"
<0006> "Hmm... Have you perhaps been a bad kid?"
<0007> "No, wait, they're all empty! All the presents are gone!"
<0008> "There's a note inside one of the bags... What does it say?"
<0009> < Present abduction courtesy of WARUDA\nP.S. Santa is a dummy >
<0010> "...Waah!!! It's those bad kids again!?"
<0011> "...Hm? What's the matter, Aru?"
<0012> "Rein! All the presents have been stolen! Can you smell where they might have gone?"
<0013> "Let me try."
<0014> *sniff sniff*
<0015> "I got it! There's a trail that we can follow to find the presents!"
<0016> "Alright! Let's go get the presents back!"
<0017> "<player>, I hope you don't mind helping us. Together we can save Christmas!"
<0018> "Big news, <player>! We have found the hideout of the Waruda!"
<0019> "Let's go get our presents back!"
<0020> "Their hideout should be around here..."
<0021> "There's no doubt about it, we're really close."
<0022> "Ah, there they are!"
<0023> "Oh, Santa's here!"
<0024> "Heh, took her long enough."
<0025> "Welcome to the party, Santa! You're free to join, but we'll be keeping the presents."
<0026> "No way! The presents are not yours to keep. They belong to all the kids around the world."
<0027> "That's where you're wrong. You see, this year..."
<0028> "...only the bad kids get presents!"
<0029> "Yeah, and that's us!"
<0030> "Present party for us!"
<0031> "That's not how this works at all! Give me back the presents!"
<0032> "Aru, try to calm down a little. If we properly explain why this is important, maybe we can resolve things peacefully."
<0033> "You're right, Rein. ...Okay, I've got this under control."
<0034> "So says the Santa who lost all the presents and didn't even notice."
<0035> "You're a mix of stupid and dumb. Talk about hopeless."
<0036> "Stuuupid!"
<0037> "Kuh..."
<0038> "Did the cat get your tongue? I have some good medicine for that."
<0039> "That'd be a waste. This Santa here is just as big of an idiot as that puppy. No meds can cure that level of idiocy."
<0040> "Alright, now you've done it! It's time for Santa to teach you some Christmas spirit!"
<0041> "...It turned into a battle after all."
<0042> "Damn it, what a shameful defeat..."
<0043> "Beaten by the bunny once again..."
<0044> "This red rabbit is ravenous and... horrifying..."
<0045> "It's just my clothes that are red! ...And doesn't that go for you too?!"
<0046> "Anyway, I'm glad that the presents are safe and sound."
<0047> "Whatever. Just take them back, I don't care about them anymore."
<0048> "B-but boss! We'll have no presents!"
<0049> "No present party for us!"
<0050> "It was pretty bad of you to steal them..."
<0051> "But you know, I actually had presents for you guys too!"
<0052> "Eeeh!?"
<0053> "You're Yuki, right? This is for you helping out a friend."
<0054> "I-it's not like I wanted anything..."
<0055> "Tomato and Mimyuu, for looking after each other."
<0056> "We're very close friends! You sure we can have these?"
<0057> "Whee, I got a present! *booom*"
<0058> "And Kiriko, to apologize for wrongly suspecting you before..."
<0059> "I hope it's some dangerous medicine!"
<0060> "A-anyway, there's also a present for Krilalaris. Is she here?"
<0061> "She's probably at a circus right now."
<0062> "Leave it to Mimyuu! She can take care of it!"
<0063> "Alright, but... please don't blow it up!"
<0064> "That's all the presents... I hope you all try to be a little better kids from now on!"
<0065> "Ho-ho-ho! I wish you a Merry Christmas!"
<0066> "Phew... They sure are a mischievous bunch, year after year."
<0067> "But all's well that ends well."
<0068> "Thank you very much for helping to save Christmas, <player>! Here, this present is for you."
<0069> "I must hurry up to deliver the rest of the presents now..."
<0070> "All the children are excitedly awaiting their presents... And there's a friend I want to visit too."
<0071> "I need all the help I can get to finish on time, so you'd better help me too."
<0072> "Right! Full speed ahead!"
<0073> "Together we can protect the smiles of children all across the world!"
