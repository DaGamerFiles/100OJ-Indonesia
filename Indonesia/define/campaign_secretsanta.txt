// (miof)
<0000> Selamat Hari Natal ♥

// (qp)
<0001> Hah?

// (sweetcreator)
<0002> Kamu ngomong apa sih?

// (sweetbreaker)
<0003> Ini bulan April.

// (saki)
<0004> April Mop udah lewat, tau.

// (tomomo)
<0005> Aku tau ada yang gak beres dengan pikiranmu, tapi kayaknya udah kelewat batas sekarang...

// (miof)
<0006> I do know it's April. I'm just saying we should make it Christmas for today.

// (sweetbreaker)
<0007> Would you mind explaining yourself?

// (miof)
<0008> Remember how we all baked a Christmas cake back in December?

// (miof)
<0009> Ever since that time, I've been working on a perfect Christmas Cake, and today it's finally done!

// (miof)
<0010> I can't wait until December, so let's eat it now ♥

// (miof)
<0011> Also, I'm gonna send one as an early Christmas present to all those people whose cakes I replaced earlier ♥

// (qp)
<0012> It's so early people probably won't see them as a Christmas gift, but I think that's a nice gesture.

// (saki)
<0013> Wasn't that a lot of people?

// (miof)
<0014> Exactly two million people, as a matter of fact!

// (sweetcreator)
<0015> I see. That's a wonderful idea to make people happy with sweets.

// (tomomo)
<0016> I can't believe such a nice plan came out of your mouth. People really can change...

// (aru)
<0017> Hold it right there!!!

// (qp)
<0018> Oh, it's Aru. And Arthur and Nico are here, too.

// (aru)
<0019> What do you mean, Christmas in April! As Santa, I cannot allow that!

// (arthur)
<0020> So, this is why you suddenly took off running from our cherry blossom party, huh? Just how good is your hearing?

// (aru)
<0021> And what's even more unforgivable... you want us to work overtime delivering two million presents!

// (nico)
<0022> Why does Nico feel that's what Santa's really mad about?

// (sweetbreaker)
<0023> There, there. It's just make-believe, so don't be so upset.

// (aru)
<0024> I have to be! Christmas is in December, and that's a universal principle!

// (saki)
<0025> Wow, look how angry Aru is. Seems like we accidentally pushed her buttons.

// (miof)
<0026> You gotta lighten up, or else I'm gonna have to get a bit physical to shut your little mouth up.

// (aru)
<0027> Fine! As Santa, I'll stop you at all costs! Arthur, Nico, I need you both to give me a hand here!

// (arthur)
<0028> Guess I have no choice. Let's get this over with and get back to our party.

// (nico)
<0029> Not quite sure what's going on here, but Nico thinks this is gonna be fun.

// (aru)
<0030> You there, say your prayers!

// (miof)
<0031> Bring it on ♥

// ========= Scene:  Secret Santa Ending =========

// (miof)
<0032> Aku menang ♥

// (aru)
<0033> Ugh... No... We can't deliver two million presents in April, because I can only use my Santa powers on Christmas...

// (miof)
<0034> Aku gak bilang apa-apa soal kamu mengirmkan kue.

// (aru)
<0035> Apa?

// (miof)
<0036> Why would I make you do that when I can do it with my magical power?

// (aru)
<0037> So, we won't have to deliver anything? Thank goodness!

// (miof)
<0038> Of course not. You guys can even have one of my cakes ♥

// (aru)
<0039> I-If that's your plan, I'll make an exception and allow your Christmas in April!

// (arthur)
<0040> So, it's just that Santa didn't want to deliver the cakes after all, huh...

// (nico)
<0041> Nico's happy for you, Santa. We should have that cake back at our flower viewing party.

// (aru)
<0042> Sweet Gods, you can all join us if you want to.

// (allsweetgods)
<0043> Sure!

// (miof)
<0044> Today's gonna be a pretty good day ♥
