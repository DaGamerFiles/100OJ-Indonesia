<0007> This looks like fun! Yaaay!
<0008> Don't underestimate me...
<0009> I'm the smartest aviator in the sky.
<0010> He he he...
<0011> This will be a fun surprise.
<0012> This is my secret technique!
<0013> I just learned this trick the other day!
<0014> Let's see... I use this here...
<0015> Mmm... it's time to go all out!
<0016> Go! Little Magnum!
<0017> Fue...? It's morning...?
<0018> Daddy! Is breakfast ready?
<0019> Today's gonna be a good day!
<0020> It's GO time!
<0021> No fun!
<0022> So boring!
<0023> This is boring! I wanna do something!
<0024> I wanna go out!
<0025> Waaai!
<0026> Punishment!
<0027> Justice cannon!
<0028> Attaaaack!
<0029> Waah!

<0032> Stop that!
<0033> Nice! You have my thanks!
<0034> Good, keep on healing me!
<0035> Fu-fu-fu, this is very good.
<0036> Fuee... that hit the spot!
<0037> It's a new destination...!
<0038> Oooh... What is this?
<0039> T-that was surprising...
<0040> I-I feel a bit dizzy...
<0041> Uu... I don't want to have a nap yet...
<0042> Nooo... I want to play more!
<0043> Ueeeeh...
<0044> Okay okay, I gotta get serious now...
<0045> I challenge you!
<0046> I'm the best pilot around! Fight me!
<0047> Let's play - I mean, train!
<0048> Hey you! Hand over whatever it is you're holding!
<0049> You're pretty brave to challenge me...!
<0050> I accept!
<0051> O-ho, we have a daring challenger...
<0052> It's a match!
<0053> Ready... go!
<0054> Dodge this if you can!
<0055> Hahaa!
<0056> Wa ha ha ha.
<0057> Uwah...
<0058> Hey!
<0059> N-not bad...
<0060> I'll tell Daddy!
<0061> Waah! Daddy!!!
<0062> Ueeh! I won't forgive you...
<0063> I'm losing altitude!
<0064> No way! I'm going down!
<0065> I think it was like this... go! Phew, easy.
<0066> I did it!
<0067> Oh...? It wasn't that hard.
<0068> Mmm... there!
<0069> E-hem!
<0070> Fu-fu-fu. I'm just too good at this.
<0071> I'm simply the best aviator around.
<0072> How was that, Daddy!
<0073> I wanna go home now...
<0074> Waaan, I just got bullied!
<0075> Daddy, come kick this bully's butt!
<0076> Waah! Bully!
<0077> Yaaaay! Shiny!
<0078> Oooh! It's like I'm flying in the night sky...
<0079> Oh, what's this on the ground?
<0080> A treasure!?
<0081> Did I just drop something? Well, whatever.
<0082> What?! My pocket money!
<0083> Hey! Where'd they go?!
<0084> Not the treasure!
<0085> Whoever did this is a bully!
<0086> Geez, this is the worst.
<0087> Waaah! I hate this!
<0088> Why would anyone do this!
<0089> O-ho... Finally a worthy opponent!
<0090> You don't scare me!
<0091> What's this? Looks funny!
<0092> It's big but looks slow... no problem!
<0093> I wanna do some treasure hunting!
<0094> I like pretty things.
<0095> So busy, so busy.
<0096> Let's see, the first task of the day is...
<0097> This will be no problem at all.
<0098> I'm the best, after all.
<0099> Okay, I'll train hard today!
<0100> Time to find some easy marks.
<0101> I'm Mescal. Nice to meetcha.
<0102> Can you play with me?
<0103> I feel like playing a board game.
<0104> Let's have some fun out there!
<0105> Alright, I'll go all out!
<0106> I'll win this game, whatever it takes!
<0107> This field looks like tons of fun!
<0108> Let's do this!
<0109> Whee! We won!
<0110> I'm super happy!
<0111> We did it!
<0112> This is only the beginning!
<0113> This looks cool!
<0114> O-ho! Treasure!
<0115> O-ho-ho, this is very very precious...
<0116> You should treasure this.
<0117> Roger that!
<0118> Good.
<0119> Okay~

<0141> Daaaaddyy! Stop hanging about and go back to the farm!
<0142> Daddy, what are you doing here? You should be working on the farm.
<0143> You do the dishes today!
<0144> Stupid Daddy! You should go work on the farm!
<0145> Hey! It's time for your training!
<0146> What, you need more training? Guess it can't be helped...
<0147> Wa ha ha, train another few years and maybe you can beat me!
<0148> This one didn't count! Another one, another one!
<0149> New Mescal Pirates, go!
<0150> Are you the big bad boss Daddy told me about?
<0151> That's a cool ride! It's mine now!
<0152> Hey guys, I don't need your help!
<0153> Hey! I could've taken care of this on my own!
<0154> Oh? Thanks! I'll patch you up later.
<0155> You guys had better not lose, you hear!
