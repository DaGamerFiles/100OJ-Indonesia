< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SPRING2019_INSTRUCTION_06 >
Build your co-op deck freely using the new Deck Point system! More powerful cards cost more Deck Points to bring with you. Remember that all cards are used by you and your allies.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SPRING2019_INSTRUCTION_07 >
Note that many characters' Hyper cards work differently in co-op! You can toggle between regular and co-op cards in the Binder to look at the effects in detail.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SPRING2019_INSTRUCTION_08 >
Your Deck Point pool is determined by your character rating. A-ranked characters are considered most fitting for that role, and start with 10 Deck Points. 

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SPRING2019_INSTRUCTION_09 >
Characters with a lower rating for each role have more Deck Points to compensate. Experiment with different character/role combinations!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SPRING2019_INSTRUCTION_10 >
Bosses move on the field and can attack you! They only activate movement-related panels (Move, Warp etc.) Always keep their location in mind for your tactics.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SPRING2019_INSTRUCTION_11 >

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SUMMER2020_INSTRUCTION_02 >
A new minigame will trigger every 10 chapters. All players will participate in it at the same time!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SUMMER2020_INSTRUCTION_03 >
Cast your hook with the left click of your mouse to catch fish. Look underwater to find the fish you want by moving your mouse around.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SUMMER2020_INSTRUCTION_04 >
After selecting a spot, your hook will sink down to the bottom, and you will automatically reel up the first fish or piece of junk in its way.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SUMMER2020_INSTRUCTION_05 >
Each fish has their own weight and speed. Catch fast or big fish to gain more score!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SUMMER2020_INSTRUCTION_06 >
The minigame may speed up randomly. This includes both fish speed and your own hook speed.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SUMMER2020_INSTRUCTION_07 >
All players are ranked by their fish score at the end of the fishing phase. Players will be rewarded with Wins based on their ranking and stars based on score.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SUMMER2020_INSTRUCTION_08 >
Pay attention to the grill! It always has a set of 3 fish to catch, and catching them all scores an extra 15 points!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SUMMER2020_INSTRUCTION_09 >
Everyone has their own grill to fill, so try to complete more sets than your opponents within the time limit!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SUMMER2020_INSTRUCTION_10 >
Furthermore, catching the same fish type several times in a row will give extra Combo points toward your score.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_FALL2020_INSTRUCTION_04 >
Upon picking up a mushroom, you receive a card with a random effect. The effects are only revealed when you use them, and are randomized each game.

Christmas cakes around the world are in danger! We must search far and wide and dispose of Mio's abominable cakes!

A special "Mio's False Cake" card will be added to every player's hand every 6 chapters.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_WINTER2022_INSTRUCTION_02 >
To safely dispose of this foul creation, either consume it (at your own peril) for a random effect, or throw it at an opponent to deal 1 damage.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_WINTER2022_INSTRUCTION_03 >
Playing event games in any game mode will reward you tasty Christmas cakes which can be used in the Shop to unlock rewards. The event can be toggled off when creating a game.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_WINTER2022_INSTRUCTION_04 >
The event is successful when all of Mio's "cakes" have been safely disposed of by players all around the world.
