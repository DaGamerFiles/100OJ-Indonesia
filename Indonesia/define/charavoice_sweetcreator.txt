<000> Noja!
<001> Nojah!
<002> There.
<003> Plonk.
<004> I'm playing a card.
<005> I'm going to thoroughly corner you with this.
<006> Kuuu-ku-ku.
<007> I like bringing chaos to order.
<008> I'm burying some honey down here.
<009> I'm spitting out some gum here. *Spit*
<010> Come get yourself covered in some cookie dough.
<011> I simply love pulling pranks.
<012> Ku-ku-ku, battlefield doping.
<013> Grant me the power of sweets!
<014> I may be a Sweet God, but I may not be that sweet to my enemy.
<015> I won't miss this chance.
<016> Super Sweet Time!
<017> Guuh, I can't afford to be sleeping anymore.
<018> Fair morning.
<019> The one who hit me earlier, now where'd they go?
<020> Have you any idea how angry I am?
<021> Of course I sometimes fail.
<022> Phew, there's something even a god can't do anything about, huh.
<023> I'm taking some more rest here.
<024> I guess it was more serious than I thought?
<025> Uoryaaah!
<026> You made me use this power, impressive.
<027> I'm going to get aggressive here.
<028> Expect no mercy!
<029> Ouch.
<030> That's not sweet at all.
<031> Bue.
<032> I'm going to cry.
<033> Sweet ♥
<034> That's very relaxing.
<035> I'm getting back my energy.
<036> How nice.
<037> Oh?
<038> Hmm?
<039> Did I just fly in the air?
<040> Oh boy oh boy oh boy.
<041> Argh...
<042> I'm in so much pain.
<043> My eyes are getting blurry.
<044> I'll be gone for a bit.
<045> Sometimes even I want to get a little physical, you know.
<046> Just do me a favor and let me kick your butt ♥
<047> I'm going to smack you pretty hard with this sponge cake.
<048> You want me to smother you in honey?
<049> Oh? You're being fairly aggressive, aren't you?
<050> Physical force doesn't solve anything.
<051> What is your problem?
<052> I'm a god, you know. What are you going to do to me?
<053> Sugar Attack!
<054> Honey Beam!
<055> Cream Spray!
<056> Chocolate Crash!
<057> Guwaaaah!
<058> Knock it off.
<059> Buheh.
<060> Guaah.
<061> That hurts like heck!
<062> That's fatal!
<063> I'm tearing up.
<064> Gyaaaaah!
<065> Hieh!
<066> You have to calm down, okay?
<067> That was so close!
<068> I sensed that coming...!
<069> Huh, is that all you have?
<070> I feel quite good.
<071> Fine exercise.
<072> I'm strong.
<073> Isn't this too much?
<074> I really am in pain.
<075> What if I broke a bone? Don't you feel any guilt?
<076> Making me grovel like this, impressive...
<077> Whatever you do, you need money.
<078> Well, not like I hate doing stuff like this.
<079> Creating sweets also costs money.
<080> Thanks for that.
<081> I'm getting poorer by the minute...
<082> No, that's mine.
<083> I'm getting a lot of emotional stress here.
<084> MONEY!!!
<085> Whoa! What the!
<086> Worst trap ever...
<087> My wings might come off.
<088> What have you done to a god?
<089> Ah, I'd better stay away.
<090> I somehow have a bad feeling about that thing.
<091> Oh, you want a piece of me?
<092> That thing's surrounded by such an evil aura.
<093> Let's gather some money.
<094> Is this a so-called "money game"?
<095> Helping stimulate the economy isn't bad, is it?
<096> You know what... Even a god wants to be rich.
<097> The sweet essence running in my veins is telling me to do this.
<098> I suppose it's time to show my great power.
<099> I just randomly want to... lash out at other people.
<100> Battle time.
<101> Oh, did I catch your attention?
<102> Fu-fu, I'm Sweet Creator, the leader of the Sweet Gods.
<103> You want to play with me?
<104> All right, let 's go out and play!
<105> *Cracks knuckles*
<106> I've never been more ready.
<107> Which one of them should I start taking care of?
<108> Let the fun game begin.
<109> Admire me to the fullest extent.
<110> Praise me, praise me.
<111> Let's throw a sweets party and celebrate.
<112> Did you see? I did really well out there, didn't I! *Smug*
<113> Oh, is that a new product?
<114> Oh, it seems like that thing really made your day.
<115> Let me see what you've earned there.
<116> That'll probably help you in your next game.
<117> Okay.
<118> Congrats.
<119> That's good.
<120> No.
<121> Oh man...
<122> You're in luck.
<123> What in the...?
<124> Let's go!
<125> There!
<126> You can do this, okay?
<127> Yo!
<128> Hmm.
<129> Way to go.
<130> That's fantastic.
<131> Damn it!
<132> I'm using this one.
<133> Hmm, I've never seen power like this.
<134> Let me make a little ruckus here.
<135> This is divine power!
<136> Thanks.
<137> I'll punish you if you keep misbehaving, okay?
<138> You're far too hardworking and diligent, if you ask me.
<139> *Smirk*. Thought defeating me would be a piece of cake? Pun intended!
<140> You're one stubborn girl...
<141> Oh, you must be the new one amongst us. Let me see what you have.
<142> Oh, what an energetic puppy.
<143> Well, good luck supporting me as one of the Sweet Gods, okay?
<144> Ugh, you'd better learn how to respect your boss...
<145> I'll show you I'm the best amongst us.
<146> You're turning against me!?
<147> Well, I'm the best, after all. The best!
<148> Th-this loss makes me look rather bad...
<149> A game of Sweet Gods, how interesting...
<150> I'm sure this is going to turn out to be a fun game.
<151> This game will decide... who loves sweets the most.
<152> Would you look at this! Who have we here? I'm thrilled.
<153> Hope you appreciate it.
<154> That's one of my creations... enjoy it to the fullest!
<155> Sweets bring happiness, don't they... Ku-ku-ku.
<156> Go ahead and eat all you want!
<157> That's one of Breaker's abilities...
<158> Sweet Breaker, I need your help.
