<0000> (*Guuuu*...)
<0001> My stomach... It's occupied by darkness. My life is at stake...
<0002> Oh?
<0003> What seems to be the problem, young lady?
<0004> My stomach is overtaken by darkness... I no longer even have the energy to cast a magic spell...
<0005> In other words... you mean you are so hungry that you cannot move...?
<0006> That is the unmistakable truth...
<0007> Poor thing. Repa believes she has some candy left in her pocket.
<0008> Let's see... There it is.
<0009> It is only a tiny ball of candy, but Repa hopes it will extend your life.
<0010> Hau, you're a fallen angel who has descended into this dark world to save my life... I will enjoy the taste of your angelic love.
<0011> (*Crunch, crunch, crunch*)
<0012> You really devoured that. Repa feels even more pity for you now.
<0013> The darkness within me has slightly abated...
<0014> (*Guuuuu*...)
<0015> It has returned...
<0016> Repa knew one tiny candy would not last very long.
<0017> This is it. The flame of my life is doomed to be extinguished...
<0018> You seem to be rather distressed.
<0019> Since Repa decided to lend you a helping hand, she wants to take care of you until you get better, but hmm...
<0020> If only there were an event where you were able to get your hands on a lot of candies, but of course no such convenient thing exists.
<0021> Oh, Krila, are you playing a zombie or something?
<0022> If it isn't...
<0023> Hmm, Repa recognizes this lady.
<0024> Today's Halloween. Look at my cosplay, I'm a blood-covered female doctor!
<0025> That's what you always look like... Oh wait.
<0026> What is Halloween?
<0027> Kiriko, grant sweetness or feel the fear of darkness...
<0028> What's that supposed to mean? Trick or treat?
<0029> *Nods*
<0030> Everything you say is always so roundabout. Whatever.
<0031> Here, I baked these cookies myself.
<0032> Heaven's grace...!
<0033> You there, you can have some too.
<0034> Oh my... She even gave Repa some cookies. What is going on here?
<0035> *Munch, munch*... Halloween is an event where people give you sweets.
<0036> The only condition is to chant a spell: "Trick or treat."
<0037> So there actually is such a convenient thing...
<0038> In any case, I have been saved...
<0039> Fufufu.
<0040> In point of fact, every part of my body is brimming with dark vigor.
<0041> *Munch, munch*
<0042> You're right. These cookies are somehow making Repa incredibly energetic too.
<0043> I said I baked them - of course they won't be any regular cookies.
<0044> I call them "Kiri-Kookies" and they give you a boost of energy the moment you bite into them.
<0045> I sense that the sealed darkness is about to be unleashed... Kukuku, I fear nothing now.
<0046> Repa also feels she can do anything.
<0047> I shall exploit all this energy to obtain the power of darkness...
<0048> (*Guuuuuuuuuuuuu*...)
<0049> Hmm?
<0050> Oh dear, why is your belly growling that loudly right after eating cookies...?
<0051> (*Guuuu*...)
<0052> Huh? Repa's belly is also making surprising noises.
<0053> Kukuku.
<0054> What an evil laugh...!
<0055> Kiriko... I demand an explanation.
<0056> Like I told you, the Kiri-Kookies give you energy... but, in exchange, they burn a massive amount of calories.
<0057> Think of it as this way: They make you able to move five times faster than usual in return for burning ten times as many calories as you usually consume.
<0058> Such low energy efficiency!
<0059> Kiriko, you set us up...!
<0060> I both trick and treat people. That's how I spend my Halloweens.
<0061> Now, I suggest you two go snatch as much candy as you can before you run out of energy.
<0062> Rats, that leaves me no choice. Listen, Fallen Angel.
<0063> Are you referring to Repa?
<0064> *Nods*. You and I will form an alliance of darkness with each other.
<0065> So, you want Repa to join you.
<0066> We're two maidens who have fallen for a filthy trap. The only way that we can survive it is to gather sweets. Hence...
<0067> You want the two of us to work together and gather a bunch of sweets to throw a tea party?
<0068> *Nods*
<0069> Fine, Repa will help you with that in order to save her belly.
<0070> *Reaches out a hand*
<0071> *Shakes hands firmly*
<0072> Now, for the sake of sweets...
<0073> We will trick or treat...!
<0074> A mountain of sweets. This is like a dream.
<0075> Repa made us tea from the best tea leaves she has. Now, let us take a seat and treat ourselves.
<0076> I admire you, Fallen Angel... I mean, Angel.
<0077> Let's have some. *Bite* *Munch, munch*
<0078> It tastes like all the happiness in the world combined. With the darkness gone, only the pure heart remains.
<0079> I-is that that good? Let Repa try this one here.
<0080> *Munch* *Sip*
<0081> Th-this cupcake... It goes quite well with the tea.
<0082> Angel, open that tiny mouth of yours.
<0083> Well... Aaaaa-a.
<0084> Relish the taste of the sweets that purified my heart.
<0085> *Bite*... This is very good too...!
<0086> Fufufu.
<0087> Let Repa do it for you too. Open your mouth.
<0088> Aaaa... *Bite* *Munch, munch*...
<0089> How is it? Is it delicious?
<0090> This is... what they call God's Blessing. It is so tasty that my mouth might grow wings and fly me away.
<0091> Fufufu, it is as delicious, is it not?
<0092> We sure gathered piles of sweets.
<0093> Generally, consuming a large amount of sweet foods means gaining weight. However, that is not the case for us now.
<0094> We won't get fat no matter how much we eat. Now Repa feels like thanking those cookies for this.
<0095> Kukuku. Kiriko's trick brought us happiness. Nay, we succeeded in turning her trick into happiness.
<0096> Repa Kesukaan that thought.
<0097> *Bite*... *Munch, munch*
<0098> (The effect of my cookies has long worn off, though.)
<0099> Angel, would you refill my teacup?
<0100> Just call me Repa. Here, Repa refilled your cup, Krila.
<0101> Words cannot describe my gratitude. Thank you, Repa.
<0102> Fufufu.
<0103> Fufufu.
<0104> Kukuku.
